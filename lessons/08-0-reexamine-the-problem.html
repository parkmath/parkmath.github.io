    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
          <p>A census taker came to a house where a man lived with
            3 daughters. “What are your daughters’ ages?” she asked.<br>
            The man replied, “The product of their ages is 36, and
            the
            sum of their ages is equal to our house number.”<br>
            “That’s still not enough information” the census taker said,
            after looking
            at the number.<br>
            “Sorry, I have to go”, the man said, “my oldest daughter
            needs help making blueberry pancakes”.</p>

          <p>      The census taker then promptly wrote down the three
            daughters’ ages and
            moved on to the next house. How did she know the ages? What
            are the ages?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Some mathematics problems are challenging because they just
    do not seem to provide enough information to the reader to be
    solved. Often, though, that is because we have not looked
    carefully enough at the question and thought about what each of
      the words being used implies. To <em class="vocab">Re-examine the Problem</em> is to
    look at each and every word, term, and equation in the
    statement of the problem and to see if there is more
    information to be gleaned from them if you look more
    closely.</p>


    <p>In the problem above, at first it seems that much of the
    information given is completely unhelpful and irrelevant.
    Although there seems to be insufficient information to
    determine the daughters’ ages, that should prompt us to
    re-examine the problem to see if some of that “irrelevant”
    information can in fact be used productively. While knowing the
    product of the ages is 36 doesn’t tell us the ages of the
    daughters, it does limit the possibilities of what the ages
    could be. What are the possibilities? And although we don’t
    know the house number, the census taker does, and yet she still
    cannot say for sure what the ages are. So, which of the
    possibilities that you listed are consistent with that fact?
    And while blueberry pancakes are soon to be eaten by the man
    and his daughter, is that the only piece of additional
    information you can get from that sentence?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>Three squares are placed next to each other as shown. The
        vertices A, B,
        and C are collinear. Find the dimensions of the largest
        square.

    </div>

    <p>Sometimes, even when a problem does not seem to be all that
    complicated, we still find that there seems to be insufficient
    information. Often that is because we have not looked fully at
    what the words in the question imply. For example, although you
    likely took care to label the lengths of all 12 sides of the 3
    squares, did you ask yourself what it means for A, B, and C to
    be collinear? What do line segments AB and BC thus have in
    common? It is easy for us to “read past” certain words without
    fully grasping what they are telling us. Carefully <em class="vocab">re-examining
      the problem</em> gives us a chance to really slow down and look, as
    if with a microscope, at each individual part.</p>

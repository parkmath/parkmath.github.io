        <p>The number 73 can be written as the sum of 73 consecutive
        integers.
        What is the product of these 73 integers?
        <cite>(Copyright <a href="http://www.mathleague.com">mathleague.com</a>.)</cite></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>If you were reading a book about juggling for beginners, and
    it recommended starting out by trying to juggle 7 balls, you
    would rightly think that advice was crazy. Even someone who had
    no idea how to juggle could tell you that starting out with 3
    (or even 2!) balls lets you get a better handle on what is
    going on. Before one tackles complicated problems, it makes
    sense to try easier, related ones first.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, the way we cut a problem that is
    intimidatingly large or confusingly abstract down to size is to
    <em class="vocab">Change or Simplify the Problem</em>. In the problem above, having to
    deal with 73 integers makes the problem initially seem
    extremely hard. How would one even approach finding the 73
    consecutive integers that add to 73, and how on earth if you
    found them could you find their product in a reasonable amount
    of time?</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Trying a Smaller Number</em> is a very popular and useful way to
    change or simplify the problem. As with the juggling, it
    frequently allows you to get a much better understanding of
    what is going on. So in the problem above, why not see if you
    can simplify it by replacing all the 73’s with 5’s. Then,
    hopefully you can use the insight you have gained with the
    easier problem to solve the original problem as well. Give it a
    try!</p>

    <p class="new-page">Another variation on this theme occurs when a problem is
    stated in terms of variables like $X$ or $Z$,
    such as:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>At Bob's Breakfast Bungalow, the toast buffet involves $X$ kinds of bread and $Z$ kinds of jam. How many different bread-jam pairings are there, assuming that the customers use only one kind of jam each time they make toast?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>When stated so abstractly (“$X$ kinds of bread and $Z$ kind of jam”), the
    problem can be hard to think about. <em class="vocab">Changing Variables to
    Numbers</em> is another way to change or simplify the problem. Why
    not try specific numbers for $X$ and $Z$ to get a better sense of
    what is going on? It might make sense to try a few different
    pairs of numbers so that you can be sure that you have the right
    idea. Once you do, then, as with trying a smaller number, you
    can use what you have learned to go back and solve the
    original, more abstract (and likely more complicated)
    problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You add up $X$
      randomly chosen positive numbers. How many times larger is this

      <p>Some students
      stood evenly spaced in a circular formation. They counted off,
      starting at 1 and continuing by consecutive integers once
      around the circle, clockwise. How many students were there in
      the circle if the student furthest from student 19 was student
      83? <cite>(Copyright <a href="http://www.mathleague.com">mathleague.com</a>.)</cite></p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Giuseppe likes to
      count on the fingers of his left hand, but in a peculiar way.
      He starts by calling the thumb 1, the first finger 2, the
      middle finger 3, the ring finger 4, and the pinkie 5, and then
      he reverses direction, so the ring finger is 6, the middle
      finger is 7, the first finger is 8, the thumb is 9, and then he
      reverses again so that the first finger is 10, the middle
      finger is 11, and so on.</p>

      <p>One day his parents surprise him by saying that if he can tell
      them some time that day what finger the number 1,234,567 would
      be, he can have a new sports car. Giuseppe can only count so
      fast, so what should he do?</p>

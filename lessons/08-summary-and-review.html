      <p>This curriculum was written by members (past and present) of the upper 
school math department at the Park School of Baltimore. This was possible 
thanks to Park School’s F. Parvin Sharpless Faculty and Curricular 
Advancement (FACA) program, which supports faculty every summer in major 
curricular projects. In addition to the support of FACA by the Nathan L. 
Cohen Faculty Enhancement fund and the Joseph Meyerhoff FACA fund, this 
project was also funded by grants from the E. E. Ford Foundation, the 
Benedict Foundation, Josh and Genine Fidler, and an anonymous donor.</p>

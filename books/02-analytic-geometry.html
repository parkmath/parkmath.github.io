        <p>Why are manhole covers circular, instead of square?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>You may have heard this “old chestnut” before. (If you have,
      don’t spoil it for everyone else!) If you haven’t, you
      may not have any idea how to even begin to think about
      the problem. Since this is a question about shapes, it
      may help to draw a picture. Better yet, you could build
      a model of the situation using, say, a cylindrical oatmeal
      box and a more rectangular box of cocoa powder. Now that
      you have a model, play around with it. Look at it from
      all different angles. Try placing the covers on the different
      “manholes.” Do you notice anything?</p>

    <p>There are many ways to <em class="vocab">visualize</em> in
      solving a problem. Sometimes visualizing can be as simple
      as plotting several points on a graph and interpreting
      what you see. Visualizing can also involve <strong>altering</strong>
      or <strong>adding to</strong> a given picture to make the problem
      easier.</p>

    <div class="problem new-page">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>How many square units are enclosed by the polygon DANCE
          below?
        </p>
        <figure class="fig-50">
          <img src="../images/02-0-visualize/9-2 habits visualize 2.png"
          alt="">
        </figure>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p>You may have divided the figure in the previous problem into
      triangles, or even “boxed it in” and found the area of
      the rectangles you’d created. Either way, the way you reconceived
      the diagram made it much easier to solve.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="problems">
    <p>In the problems that follow, one of two strategies will help
      you: 1) Draw or build a model of the situation to make
      it easier to understand. 2) Alter an existing diagram in
      some way to gain more information, or simply to help you
      look at the diagram in a different way.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Below is the usual arrangement of 10 bowling pins, with
        the “single pin” at the bottom. By moving only 3 of the
        pins, can you “flip” the arrangement 180 degrees so that
        the single pin is now at the top?</p>

      <p>Alice and Bruno work in a city where the streets are laid
        out in a grid pattern. City Hall is at (0,0). Alice and
        Bruno work at (–3,–1) and (3,3) respectively. They wish
        to find an apartment at a point C such that the sum of
        the distances each of them has to walk to work is a minimum.
        Of course, Alice and Bruno can’t walk “as the crow flies”

    <p>In trying to solve problem 1, some of you might have first
    tried a little tinkering.
    The diagram does suggest that a side of the second smallest
    square might be somewhere between 6 and 9, and so you might
    have tried some or all of the
    integers 6 through 9. As it turns out, not only do none of
    these integers work, but after trying any one of the numbers it
    might not be at all clear to you
    whether it would be too high or too low. So refining the
    process to get at the answer might prove to be a bit
    challenging.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, some of you algebra lovers might have
    bypassed that
    wonderful play and jumped right into some symbolic
    representation of the length of the side. If you haven’t
    already done so, give algebra a try.</p>

  </section>
  <section class="problems">

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Representing the length of a side of the second smallest
      square (or some other square) by $x$:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Work around the diagram, and find
      an expression involving $x$ for the length of the left side
      of the rectangle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find an expression involving $x$,
      different from that in part a, for the length of the right
      side of the rectangle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">By equating the expressions in
      parts a and b, solve the resulting equation for $x$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now find the sizes of all the
      squares.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even though you might have been able to discover the answer
    by tinkering, you might also agree that the algebra approach
    was somewhat more efficient, despite the fact that it was
    certainly not a walk in the park and required a great deal of
    care and manipulation. Further, the algebra not only provided a
    solution that you could be sure of, but also provides a way for
    you to communicate your solution in a clear and convincing
    manner.</p>

    <p>Of course algebra is not a panacea. It is not the best
    approach for all such problems, and even when it is the best
    approach one still has to make decisions about which of the
    unknown properties should be replaced by variables. And even
    after you have made these decisions, you may realize that the
    equation you have written requires very difficult algebra to
    solve, so much so that you need to learn new skills to have any
    hope of solving it.</p>

    <p>In addition to its efficiency, security and its ability to
    communicate succinctly and cogently, an algebraic approach can
    provide you with a deeper understanding of the problem. In
    problem 2, for example, you might have been able to discover
    the relationship between the size of the smallest square and
    the sizes of the other squares, allowing you to see the
    solution for a starting square of any size. Using algebra can
    also allow you to investigate the possibility of multiple
    correct answers, something that a more tinkering approach is
    less likely to reveal.</p>

    <p>But can you be really sure that what you think happens in
    problem 3 always happens no matter what four numbers your start
    out with? You can of course produce a complicated verbal

      Then, tell your friend: “I can tell, just by listening, how

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your 8-year-old neighbor Joe has set up a lemonade stand.
      To help him out you agree to buy a cup, but are surprised to
      find that he charges for the cup as well as the lemonade. His
      price is 30 cents for the cup itself, and then 80 cents per
      cupful of lemonade.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How much would Joe charge for
      someone who bought the cup and then drank 5 cupfuls?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Beth spends \$5.90 at the lemonade
      stand. How much lemonade did she drink?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">You realize that you have less than
      a dollar’s worth of change, so you can’t buy a full cup. How
      much do you think Joe should charge you for getting a cup
      that’s half full of lemonade? (Remember you still need to pay
      for the cup!)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How much should Joe charge for a
      cup that’s 90% full?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an equation for $P$, the price
      of your purchase, in terms of $L$, the amount of lemonade that
      you buy, measured in cupfuls (which might not be a whole
      number).</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Linear equations are used to model the same kinds of
    patterns that you see in arithmetic sequences — patterns where
    the data show a steady rate of change. One benefit of a linear
    equation is that you’re no longer restricted to whole numbers —
    you can find the price of 3.42 cupfuls of lemonade — whereas
    with a sequence, you could only have the price of 1 cup, the
    price of 2 cups, the price of 3 cups, and so on.</p>

    <p>When you graph a linear equation, one of the most critical
    pieces of information you see on the graph is the slope of the
      line. Recall that <em class="vocab">slope</em> is a measure of the steepness of a
    line, and is calculated by finding “rise over run” — for
    example, the line below “rises” 6 units every time it “runs” 4
    units, so its slope is 6 over 4, or 1.5.</p>

    <p>This lesson underscores the advantages of using multiple
    points of view — looking at problems or situations from several
    perspectives. Specifically we will see how shifting among
    sequences, graphs and algebraic equations can make a difficult
    problem quite accessible.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In an arithmetic sequence, ${T_1} = 10$, ${T_2} =
      14$, ${T_3} = 18$, ${T_4} = $…</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Graph the points of this arithmetic
      sequence on a coordinate plane (use $x$ to stand for $n$, and $y$ to stand for ${T_n}$).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw the line that goes through the
      points you drew.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the rate of change of the
      sequence? In what way is this rate related to the line?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an equation of the line — an
      equation showing the relationship between $x$ and $y$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The points $\left( {a,30} \right)$ and $\left( {b,60} \right)$ are on the line. Use your
      equation in part d to find $a$ and $b$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Two terms of an arithmetic sequence are ${B_3} = 40$ and ${B_{10}} = 68$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If you graphed the points of the
      sequence, and then drew the line that goes through these two
      points, what would be the slope of the line you drew?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">
      The points $\left( {12,a} \right)$, $(100, b)$, and $\left( {c,89}

      <p class="problem-part">Find the first term of the sequence
      ($x = 1$).</p>

    <p>It is customary to describe the $x$-and $y$-intercepts using
    only the $x$- or
    $y$-coordinate. For example, a line with $y$-intercept (0, 16) is
    said to have
    a $y$-intercept of 16.</p>

      always the same.</p>
      
      <p>40 minutes after you start driving, you are at an elevation
      of 700 feet above sea level. After 10 more minutes, you are
      735 feet above sea level.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What’s the rate of increase of your
      elevation?</p>

Lesson 2:


Solutions Of Linear Equations 
</h1>
          
          
          

<article>
  
  <section class="development">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The business of solving equations can sometimes be a simple
    matter, but at times can become quite complicated. It can
    range from the relatively simple task of finding a value of $x$
    that satisfies the equation $3 + x = 7$ to a problem that turns
    out to be impossible, that of finding positive integers $a$,
    $b$, and $c$ that satisfy the equation, ${a^3} + {b^3} = {c^3}$.</p>

    <p>Then there are those equations that have so many solutions
    that it would be
    impossible to write them all out. What if someone challenged
    you to find the two numbers they are thinking of and the only
    clue you had was that the sum of the numbers is 100? You are
    actually invited to solve the equation, $x + y = 100$; the
    possibilities are endless.</p>

    <p>Or what if you were faced with the task of writing out all
    the solutions to the equation $x + 3 - 5 = 9x - 8x - 2$ or to
    the inequality $3x + 6 &lt; 8$?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>By way of review, solve each of the following equations
      and inequalities for the unknown letter. Remember to be
      particularly careful with the inequalities. In particular,
      when multiplying or dividing by a negative number, you always
      have to reverse the inequality. Why must this be so?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$2y - 3y = 7 + 4y$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$3.5x - 4 = 7 - 7.5x$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$5\left( {r - 5} \right) - 3\left(
      {2 - r} \right) + 35 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$3\left( {x - 4} \right) + 15 = 35
      - 5\left( {2 - 5x} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$17x + 5 &lt; 31x - 2$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$2\left( {3.5x - 7.5x} \right) + 4
      &gt; 1$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$8 - \left( {7 - n} \right) =
      33$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$- {\textstyle{1 \over 3}}c =
      17$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$- 3 + {\textstyle{d \over 7}} =
      - 12$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$3\left( {2 + 3x} \right) = 13 -
      4\left( {3 - x} \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>To write all the solutions to the equation $3x + 7 = 22$ is
    a pretty simple task, since $x$ can be replaced by only one
    number to make the equation work, namely 5. Check it out.</p>

    <p>The question of what values of $x$ and $y$ make the equation $2x
    + y = 13$ work is a slightly more complicated question, and it
    is certainly no easy matter to find all the values of $x$ and $y$ that make the equation work.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Does $x = 3$, $y = 6$ work? How about $x = 7$, $y = - 1$? 
      What about $x = \tfrac{1}{4}$, $y = \tfrac{25}{2}$? 
      Justify your responses.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would be a systematic way of finding solutions? Use

    <p>By the way, a neat way to write a solution like $x = 7$ and

    written first, followed by the $y$-value. The expression
    $(7,-1)$ is called an <em class="vocab">ordered pair</em>. Any idea
    why?</p>

    <p>Can you list <em>all</em> the solutions to the equation $2x + y = 13$?</p>
    
    <p>The answer is probably no, since there are simply too many, but

    <p>Now let’s look at the inequality $2x + y &gt; 13$. Can you

      <p><em>The Linear Game</em></p>
      
      <p>In this game, the host, Eva, thinks up a
      linear equation in two variables $x$ and $y$. She then invites a
      contestant, say Lewis,
      to come up with the equation using the following approach.
      Lewis calls out
      an $x$ or $y$ value and Eva tells him the
      corresponding $y$ or $x$ value.</p>
      
      <p>For example, suppose Eva is thinking of the equation $3x - y
      = 11$ and Lewis says $x = 1$, then Eva says $y = - 8$, and
      if Lewis says $y = 3$, Eva says $x = \tfrac{14}{3}$. This continues until Lewis is able to figure out what

Lesson 3:


Geometry Of Lines 
</h1>
          
          
          
<article>
  
  <section class="development">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you define parallel lines? How would you decide
        if two lines were parallel?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Euclid, Ancient Greek geometer $extraordinaire$, defined
      parallel lines as lines in a plane which never meet, even
      when extended indefinitely. Line segments are parallel
      if they lie on parallel lines.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50"><img src="../images/02-3-geometry-of-lines/9-2-3 diagram 1.tif.jpg"
      alt="">
    </figure>

    <p>It was hard for those Greeks to determine if lines were parallel
      — after all, how could you show <em>for sure</em> that
      lines never met? What if you thought that lines were parallel,
      but actually they met at a point 100 miles away? This would
      happen if lines were very close to being parallel, but
      not quite.</p>

    <p>Euclid’s parallel lines remain the same distance apart, no
      matter where you take the measurements. (Think of train
      tracks with crossbars of equal length.) That might give
      a more practical way to tell if two lines are parallel
      — measure their distance apart in two different places
      and see if you get the same thing. But even that would
      not be without its problems. Your measuring instruments
      might not be accurate enough to tell if lines are just
      skewed enough to meet 100 miles away.</p>

    <p class="new-page">To illustrate how difficult it can be to tell even if two
       short line segments are parallel, look at the following
      pair, below.
    </p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-3-geometry-of-lines/image21.png" >

    <p>In fact, the line segments above were drawn so as NOT to
      be parallel to one another. They are just slightly off.</p>

    <p>In the 1600s, the French mathematician and philosopher Rene
      Descartes changed the way people thought about — and did
      — geometry. The story goes that he was lying in bed one
      day, staring at the ceiling, and realized that he could
      describe the position of a bug on his ceiling by counting
      the number of ceiling cracks up and the number of ceiling
      cracks over.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you had two line segments on a $grid$, as below, and
        knew the coordinates of a few points on each line, would
        you now have a method to decide if they were parallel?</p>
      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/02-3-geometry-of-lines/image31.PNG" >
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>Descartes’s wonderful idea allowed someone to take a geometric
      shape — a line — and describe its position exactly by overlaying
      a grid — a coordinate system. Since these coordinates had
      numbers attached, all of the sudden people were able to
      apply much of what they already knew about algebra to geometry.
      Descartes had allowed people to use multiple points of
      view when considering geometry problems, switching freely
      back and forth between an algebraic perspective and a geometric
      perspective. And, when you thought about the previous problem,
      so did you.</p>

    <p>Finally, you can calculate the position $halfway$ between

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the previous lesson, you learned about parallel and
    perpendicular lines. A pair of lines that are parallel never
    meet; other pairs of lines that you can draw on paper
    eventually will. You also learned that you can tell if lines
    are parallel by checking their slopes.

    The lines below aren’t on a coordinate system, so you won’t be
    able to check their slopes. However, to prove that they are not
    parallel, you could extend them to a point where they meet.</p>

    <p>Place an extra piece of paper next to the picture above.
    Then, using a straightedge, pick two non-parallel lines and
    extend them until they finally meet. How far away from the edge
    of the picture did they meet?</p>

    <p>Will the real square please stand up? One of these figures
    is a square. The other is an impostor.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50 two-up">

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find a way to determine which one is the square. Keep in
      mind that measuring with a ruler will not be accurate
      enough.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s another figure which really is a square:</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-4-coordinate-geometry/real square development 3.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>Or is it? As you have seen, it can be hard to tell.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would you have to check to $prove$ that this is
      indeed a square? Do so.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the previous problem, it wasn’t enough just to show
      that all the sides were the same length. Can you draw some
      four-sided figures, other than squares, where the sides are
      all the same length? Do you remember what such figures are
      called?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Similarly, it wasn’t enough to show that all of the angles
      were 90 degrees. Draw some four-sided figures other than
      squares with four 90-degree angles. What are they called?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Appearances can be deceiving. When confronted with a
    diagram, you should never assume what is not explicitly stated.
    You can’t be sure that you really have parallel lines, segments
    of the same length, etc. That is, you can’t be sure unless you
    prove it!</p>

    <p>For example, a square is defined as a quadrilateral with
    four equal sides and four 90-degree angles. So to prove that
    something is a square, you need to: 1) Check that it has four
    sides, 2) Show that the sides have the same length (using the
    distance formula, for example), and 3) Show that all angles are
    90 degrees (by comparing slopes, for example).</p>

    <p>To prove that something is not a square, you only need to
    show that it fails on at least one of the counts above. So, for
    example, if you used the distance formula to show that two
    sides of a figure were of two different lengths, you would have
    already proved that it is not a square — no need to check the
    other criteria.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the definition of a square to do the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that the four-sided shape
      with vertices on $\left( {3,0} \right)$, $\left( {7,3}
      \right)$, $\left( {4,7} \right)$, and $\left( {0,4}
      \right)$ is a square.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make up your own square, then
      construct an argument to prove to someone else that it is a
      square.</p>

      $\left( {11,-1} \right)$. Is it really a rectangle?
      Prove it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here is a picture of the rectangle from problem 7 with the
      diagonals drawn in. Do they look the same length to you?
      Either prove that they are the same length, or show that they
      are not.</p>

    <h2 style="page-break-before: always;">Going Further</h2>

    <p>Could we prove that the diagonals of $any$ rectangle are the
    same length as each other? One thing we could do would be to
    try another example. Let’s take another rectangle of a
    different size, say the one defined by $\left( {3,4} \right)$,
    $\left( {9,7} \right)$, $\left( {8,9} \right)$, and $\left(
    {2,6} \right)$. Using the distance formula, we find that the
    lengths of the diagonals are $\sqrt {{{(9 - 2)}^2} + {{(7 -
    6)}^2}} $ and $\sqrt {{{(8 - 3)}^2} + {{(9 - 4)}^2}} $,
    which both simplify to $\sqrt {50} $.</p>

    <p>Are we better off than we were before? Now we know that our
    conjecture is true for two rectangles, but that still leaves
    lots of other rectangles we’re not sure about. Another strategy
    might be to draw a rectangle that could represent any
    rectangle. To make life easiest, let’s position it so that its
    bottom edge lines up with the $x$-axis, with its left side
    touching the origin.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-4-coordinate-geometry/general rectangle attempt 2.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>We don’t want to say how long the sides are, because then
    we’d have a specific rectangle. So let’s just call the lengths
    $a$ and $b$.</p>

    <p>Notice that the coordinates of the point in the rectangle’s
    upper right corner have been left blank. We could be lazy and
    fill them in with two more letters: $\left( {c,d} \right)$.
    But there is a way to do it in terms of the other letters that
    are already in the diagram.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Read the previous paragraph (if you haven’t already) and
      find a better way to name the coordinates of the point in the
      upper right corner.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now use the distance formula to find the length of each
      diagonal of this rectangle. Note that your answers will have
      letters in them that won’t go away! How do your answers
      compare? What did you just prove?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Using symbols to represent numbers or coordinates that could
    take on any values is another example of <em class="vocab">representing
      symbolically</em>. In addition to allowing us to do the proof,
    representing the coordinates symbolically has a side benefit
    here: any calculations we do using these symbols will apply to
    any rectangle we could possibly come across.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Socrates read your work in Problem 18, and complained that

      are sitting flat on the $x$-axis. Is he right? Do you have a
      response?</p>

      <p>Now rotate your isosceles triangle of Problem 22 so that

      triangles like these, as well?</p>
    </div>

    <p>You’ve now had a bit of practice doing proofs that aren’t
    just about specific diagrams. For example, you proved that the
    diagonals in ANY rectangle are the same length.</p>

    <p>Of course, some statements you’ll investigate in geometry
    may turn out to be false. When you’re asked to prove something,
    it’s a good idea to figure out if it’s worth it to even begin
    the proof — maybe the statement wasn’t true to begin with.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>
      Whenever you test a statement in geometry to see if it’s
      true, you should <em class="vocab">visualize</em> by
      drawing several, varied pictures of the shape you’re investigating.
      If you can’t find a counterexample and the statement appears
      to be true, it’s time to look for a proof. But it is never
      good enough to prove something by doing the calculations
      on a specific shape you drew. You’ll have to <em class="vocab">represent</em>
      the coordinates <em class="vocab">symbolically</em> by
      using letters that can stand for any number. That way,
      you’ll be sure your proof works for all shapes. Practice

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the previous lesson (problem 38), we were asked to prove
    that the three
    medians of the triangle $A\left( { - 3,13} \right)$,
    $B\left( {9,1} \right)$ and $C\left( {-9,1} \right)$ all contained the point $\left(
    { - 1,5} \right)$, after first finding the equations of the
    medians. But what if you were not given the point $\left(
    { - 1,5} \right)$? How would
    you discover that point from the equations of the medians?</p>

    <p>More generally, given the equations of two lines, how could
    you find the point where those lines intersect — the solutions
    that the two equations share? The hunt for solutions that
    equations share is a useful and sometimes exciting quest, and
    can reveal interesting relationships between the equations.</p>

    <p>One could answer the question of finding a common solution
    by guessing, but there are times when guessing is extremely
    difficult. In this lesson we will explore algebraic methods of
    exploring common solutions to a set of linear equations —
    called a linear <em class="vocab">system of equations</em>. At the same time we will
    use visual approaches to promote better understanding of the
    relationships between the variables, and the nature and
    existence of common solutions.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Recall that the equations of the medians in the previous
    lesson (problem 38) were:</p>

    <ul class="horizontal">
      <li>$ \large{\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{11}{2}}$</li>
      <li>$ \large{y = - 4x + 1}$</li>
      <li>$ \large{y = \frac{{ - 2}}{5}x + \frac{{23}}{5}}$</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For the time being let’s just work with the first two
    equations and try to find a particular ordered pair $\left(
    {x,y} \right)$ which satisfies both — values of $x$ and $y$ which
    make both of them work.</p>

    <p>Since the second equation claims that $y$ is equal to $-
    4x + 1$, it seems okay to replace $y$ by $- 4x + 1$ in the first equation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What does the equation become when $y$ is replaced by $- 4x + 1$? Now solve this equation for $x$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Substitute the value of $x$ you got in problem 1 in the
      first equation to get the value of $y$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use your results from problems 1 and 2 to show that the
      medians all intersect in (contain) a single point.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The form of the median equations was particularly convenient
    to make the
    replacement/substitution for $y$. Could you do a similar
    replacement if the
    equations were written in a different form? Fortunately most
    linear equations
    can be written in a form similar to one of the median
    equations. Take a look
    at the following problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the point where the lines given by the equations $5x
      + y = 1$ and $x - 5y = 8$ intersect.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Note that from the first equation
      we get $y = 1 - 5x$, so replacing $y$ by $1 - 5x$ in the
      second equation should be fair game. Replace $y$ by $1 - 5x$ in the second equation and solve for $x$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use the value of $x$ you got in part
      a and the fact that to find the value of $y$. Check to be sure
      that the values you got for $x$ and $y$ satisfy both of the
      equations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the pair of equations in problem 4 by starting with
      the second equation. (Express $x$ in terms of $y$ and substitute
      for $x$ in the first equation.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>By the way, the method we used to find the solution in
    problems 1 through 5 is called the <em class="vocab">substitution method</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the <em class="vocab">method of substitution</em> to solve the following
      systems of equations:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x + 4y = - 29$<br>$3x - 2y = 11$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$3x - 5y = 4$<br>$5x - y = 3$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the method of substitution to solve the following
      systems.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x + y = 20$<br>$x - y = 10$</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Matt claims that he discovered that there is one
      particular ordered pair that would satisfy all three
      equations because when he graphed the lines they all met in a
      single point. Gabbi drew the graphs herself and said that she
      wasn’t quite sure. Matt could be right but she thought it was
      too close to call. Check Matt’s claim algebraically.</p>

    <p><q>O Bottom! Thou art translated!</q>
    <cite>–A Midsummer Night’s Dream</cite></p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Here is a picture of a ghost, whom you might recognize from
    the video game “Mac-Pan.” The ghost goes through the points
    $\left( {1,0} \right)$, $\left( {3,2} \right)$, and $\left(
    {4, - 1} \right)$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/original Mac-Pan.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Those annoying ghosts will never stay put. This one moves
      three units to the right. What will be the new coordinates of
      the points on the ghost that are labeled in the picture?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Someone programming a computer game would have a hard time
    giving instructions like this: “If the ghost is at
    points$\left( {1,0} \right)$, $\left( {3,2} \right)$, and
    $\left( {4, - 1} \right)$ and needs to move three units to the
    right, the new coordinates will be…” If they programmed it that
    way, then if the ghost started in a different position they
    would have to change the instructions. Instead, the
    instructions would be more like “If a part of a ghost is at the
    point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ and the ghost moves three units to
    the right, that part will land on the point…”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You fill in the rest of the previous sentence. Make sure
      it works by trying it out on the points $\left( {1,0}
      \right)$, $\left( {3,2} \right)$, and $\left( {4, - 1}
      \right)$ and plotting them on a graph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now think like a game designer and examine the more
      general problem. Ghosts can move up and down as well as right
      and left. Say the ghost’s right eye is at the point $\left(
      {x,y} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What will be the new coordinates of
      the eye if the ghost moves 5 units to the left?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What if the ghost moves 4 up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What if 2 down?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What if 3 to the right AND 4
      up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about 1 to the left AND 6
      down?</p>
    </div>

    <p>These movements that the ghost makes are called
    <em class="vocab">translations</em>. A translation of a shape changes its position,
    but doesn’t change anything else about the shape, like the size
    or the angles. A translation also doesn’t change which way the
    shape is pointing.</p>

    <p>Sometimes a game designer would like to change the way an
    object is pointing, though. For instance, in the figure below
    Mr. Mac-Pan is moving to the right, but if he changed direction
    so that he was moving upwards it might look more realistic if
    his mouth pointed up instead of to the right. This kind of
    change in an object is called a <em class="vocab">rotation</em>.</p>
    
    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/9-2-6 diagram 3.tif.jpg">
    </figure>

    <p>It’s natural to ask where a point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ would wind up after a certain rotation. The answer might not be
    obvious, but we can make this question easier for
    ourselves by thinking about a specific example first.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Rotate Mr. Mac-Pan 90 degrees counterclockwise around the
        point <nobr>$\left( {0,0} \right)$.</nobr> Think of this as “spinning”
      him, as you would a spinner in a board game — with your
      finger holding him down on $\left( {0,0} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does the top of his head
      (previously at $\left( {0,2} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his bottom jaw
      (previously at $\left( {1.5, - 1} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his “middle” (previously
      at $\left( {0,0} \right)$) land?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The rotation you did in the previous problem is called a
      <em class="vocab">90-degree rotation with center $\left( {0,0} \right)$.</em>
    When not specified, it’s assumed the rotation is
    counterclockwise.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Based on your results in the previous problem, say where a
      point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ lands after a 90-degree rotation
      with center $\left( {0,0} \right)$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Trying specific numbers when you’re asked to solve a more
      general question is an example of <em class="vocab">tinkering</em>. When you’re asked
    to come up with a formula, you can tinker by generating data
    for yourself. Use tinkering copiously in this lesson.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Where would each of the three specified points (in problem
      4) on Mac-Pan land if you instead did a rotation of 180
      degrees? How about 270 degrees?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p><em class="vocab">Tinker</em>: Make up some other simple shapes that contain the
      point $\left( {0,0} \right)$, and rotate them 90, 180, and
      270 degrees counterclockwise around the origin. Conjecture
      two more formulas describing where a point $\left( {x,y}
      \right)$ will end up — one for the 180-degree and one for the
      270-degree rotation. If necessary, cut out each shape and
      physically spin it.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In problem 4, you rotated Mr. Mac-Pan 90 degrees with center
    $(0,0)$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the same method as problem 4 — and cutting out a
      model if necessary — rotate Mr. Mac-Pan 90 degrees with
      center (0,2).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does the top of his head
      (previously at $\left( {0,2} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his bottom jaw
      (previously at $\left( {1.5, - 1} \right)$) land?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Where does his “middle” (previously
      at $\left( {0,0} \right)$) land?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another way we could transform an object is through a
      <em class="vocab">reflection</em>. Let’s start simply by considering this
    triangle.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/reflection triangle after problem 8.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>We’re going to draw the mirror image of this triangle,
    acting as if the $x$-axis were a mirror. Draw the new vertices
    and label them $A'$, $B'$, and $C'$ to
    show that they correspond to the points $A$, $B$, and $C$, just as
    the top of the ghost’s head after a translation corresponds to
    the top of the head before. Then fill in the rest of the
      triangle. This is called a <em class="vocab">reflection over the $x$-axis</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose you wanted to reflect a ghost over the $x$-axis. If
      a point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ were on the ghost, where would
      it fall?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would be the new coordinates of a point $\left( {x,y}
      \right)$ if it were instead reflected over the $y$-axis?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Another well-known feature of Mac-Pan: when a ghost eats
    Fattening Fungi, she grows twice as tall and twice as wide.</p>

    <p>This ghost is in a corner — a floor and wall formed by the
    $x$- and $y$-axes. When she expands, her “feet” need to stay on the
    floor, and she can’t expand past the wall, either, as she’s not
    your usual ghost. Here’s the ghost:</p>

<figure class="fig-50">
  <img src="../images/02-6-transformations/Dilation ghost better x-axis (problems 11-16).png">
</figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw in the new ghost, if she still expands to twice her
      length and width but can’t move through the wall or
      floor.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Where does the top of her head go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Where do her leftmost and rightmost bottom corners go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Are there any points on or in the ghost that wouldn’t
      move?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If a point $\left( {x,y} \right)$ is on this ghost, where
      does it go?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Try out your conjecture from the last question. If the
      ghost’s eyes are at $(\frac{3}{2},\frac{5}{2})$ and$(\frac{5}{2}, \frac{5}{2})$ , use your formula to predict where
      they’ll go after the ghost eats the fungus. Does that look
      right in the picture?</p>
    </div>

    <p>This type of change in shape is called a <em class="vocab">dilation</em>. In this
      case, it is a dilation of <em class="vocab">magnitude</em> 2, or a dilation by a
      <em class="vocab">factor</em> of 2. And, as with a rotation, the point that doesn’t
      move is called the <em class="vocab">center</em>. Even though it is not in the center
    of the ghost, the point $\left( {0,0} \right)$ is the center of
    this dilation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now suppose that the ghost below can’t move past the
        <em>ceiling</em> at the line $y = 4$, but she can move past the $x$-
      and $y$-axes now. If she still expands to twice her length and
      width, draw in the new, dilated ghost.</p>
      
      <figure class="fig-50">

      </figure>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">The observations in the previous problem suggest another way
    to do dilations, without using coordinates. First, we’ll start
    with a point not on a grid, and a
    triangle to dilate. Our goal is to make the triangle twice as
    big.</p>

<p></p>

<p>    Now we’ll make each point on the triangle twice as far away
    from the center headed in the same direction away. Here’s what
    that looks like for one of the points on the triangle:</p>

    <p>This, of course, was a dilation of magnitude 2, since all

    <p>One more bit of vocabulary: When you apply a transformation
      to a shape, the new figure is called the <em class="vocab">image</em> of a shape under
    that transformation. This is kind of like calling what you see
    in the mirror your image — a shape that is where you’d be if
    you were reflected over the mirror.</p>

    <p>In this section, you have learned about four types of
      transformations:</p>
    
    <p><em class="vocab">Translations</em> move a shape without changing its
      orientation</p>.

     <p><em class="vocab">Rotations</em> spin a shape around a certain point.</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Reflections</em> give the mirror image of a shape on the other side
    of a line</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Dilations/Contractions</em> stretch a shape away from a point or

    few problems will help you derive it. Let’s start just by
    thinking about dilating any shape around the point $\left(
    {3,2} \right)$. Then we’ll start to use symbols, one piece at
    a time.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the $x$-direction, how far is the point $\left( {x,y}
      \right)$ from $\left( {3,2} \right)$? Your answer should be
        a <em class="vocab">signed distance</em> — that is, if your point is to the right of
      $\left( {3,2} \right)$ the distance is positive and if your
      point is to the left of $\left( {3,2} \right)$ the distance
      is negative.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the $y$-direction, how far is $\left( {x,y} \right)$ from
      $\left( {3,2} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If $(x', y')$ is twice as far as $\left( {x,y} \right)$ from $\left(
      {3,2} \right)$, how far away is it in the $x$-direction? In
      the $y$-direction? Make sure your answer is in terms of $x$ and
      $y$, not $x'$ and $y'$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now write a formula that gives the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of $(x', y')$
      in terms of the coordinates $x$ and $y$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Test your formula on some specific points. Make sure that
      they wind up twice as far away from $\left( {3,2} \right)$ after the dilation. If not, go back and change your answers
      to the previous questions until you find a formula that
      works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now adapt your formula so that it works not just for a
      dilation by a factor of 2, but a dilation by a factor of
      $n$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Finally, adapt your formula so that it works not just for
      a dilation centered at $\left( {3,2} \right)$, but one
      centered at the point $\left( {h,k} \right)$.</p>

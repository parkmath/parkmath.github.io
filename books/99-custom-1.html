      <p>Often a problem that can seem particularly
      perplexing can be solved by looking at it in a
      different way. Sometimes the best way to keep
      track of the different information and variables
      in a problem is to draw a picture of some sort,
        to <em class="vocab">visualize</em> the information so that it is in a form that is
      easier to understand. You saw this last year as you solved a
      variety of problems, at times by constructing models, and at
      times by finding clever ways to visually represent things
      that at first seemed quite nonvisual.</p>

    <p>If you were told by a classmate that taking a cup of
    brackish lukewarm water three times a day for a month would
    heal your broken leg, you would probably laugh out loud. And
    even though your laughter might be a bit more subdued were the
    source of that statement the health segment of the evening
    news, I bet that you would nonetheless be quite skeptical. On
    many levels this would seem to you to be highly implausible,
    and so you might either absolutely dismiss it or yield to that
    nagging curiosity and check out some other sources.</p>

    <p>On the other hand there are a host of other more reasonable
    sounding claims that you might be prepared to let slide.
    Examples might include the claim that an increase in oil prices
    pushes a decline in the Dow Industrial averages, or that there
    is a strong correlation between wealth and SAT scores. It
    doesn’t seem unreasonable to hold a healthy skepticism for
    these as well.</p>

    <p>In the context of mathematics, to <em class="vocab">check for plausibility</em> is
    to routinely check the reasonableness of any statement in a
    problem or its proposed solution, regardless of whether it
    seems true or false on initial impression; to be particularly
    skeptical of results that seem contradictory or implausible,
    whether the source be peer, teacher, evening news, book,
    newspaper, internet or some other; and to look at special and
    limiting cases to see if a formula or an argument makes sense
    in some easily examined specific situations.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
  
      <p>Your classmate proposed traveling 240 miles to the beach
      at an average speed of 80 mph, and the next day traveling
      home at 40 mph. He pointed out that since you have an average
      speed of 60 mph, the total 480 miles there and back takes 8
      hours. Yet when you went to the beach, it didn’t take 8 hours
      round trip, even though you two drove at precisely the speeds
      he had proposed. Why?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <p class="new-page">It certainly seems at first glance that your classmate is
    correct, but just because a result seems superficially correct
    doesn’t make it so. When there is an apparent contradiction in
    a problem, it often pays to make a quick check or two to see if
    what is being said is plausible. For example, how long does
    each half of the beach trip take?</p>

      <p>Martin says, looking at the figure below, that the entire
      rectangle’s area divided by the area of the square inside is
      equal to $\dfrac {a} {b} + 1$. Melissa thinks that such a peculiarly
      simple answer is unlikely to be correct. Martin insists he’s
      right, and that in fact his formula would work for any values
      of $a$ and $b$ one might choose. How could Melissa check to see
      if Martin’s formula is at least plausibly correct?</p>

    <p>One particular way that we check the reasonableness of a
      solution to a problem is to <em class="vocab">examine special and limiting cases</em>.
    In the problem above, what would those cases be? Well, one
    special case would surely be when $a=b$, because you could quickly determine the right answer and check if Martin’s formula is correct there. What about if we examined
    when “$a$” was small and “$b$” was large—say $a=1$ and $b=100$, or even $a=1$ and $b=10000$? Does Martin’s formula make sense in those
    cases as well? Can you come up with another limiting case, and
    see if his formula is plausible for that case as well?</p>

    <p>Once you have checked a solution for all the limiting cases
    you can think of, if it still seems like a reasonable solution,
    you might think about how to prove it always works yourself
    from first principles. Can you come up with Martin’s
    formula?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Hero of Alexandria came up with a formula to determine the
      area of any triangle based solely on the lengths of its 3
      sides. Below are 4 formulas, all of which purport to be
      Hero’s formula. In all 4 formulas, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the
      lengths of the sides, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter, which is
      equal to half the perimeter.</p>
    
      <p align="center">$Area = \left(s-a \right)\left(s-b\right)\left(s-c\right)$</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Which of these formulas do you think
    is the right one? Why?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Try seeing if the formulas give the
    kind of answers you would expect for various “common” triangles
    you have experience with.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now pick the formula you are most
    confident is the right one. Does the fact that it has passed

      says that you would always get 0, regardless of the 6 numbers
      you chose. Sassafras disagrees, and says it is highly
      dependent on choosing the right 6 numbers; for example, in

      <p>This diagnostic test is 98% accurate (returns a positive
      result) for people who have simpsonitis and 95% accurate
      (returns a negative result) for people who do not have
      simpsonitis. Approximately 0.3% of people in the country
        actually have this disease.</p>
      
      <p>Unfortunately, several days after taking the blood test, Bart
      receives a phone call from Dr. Kalvakian. The doctor tells
      him that he tested positive for the disease. Bart asks,
      “What’s the chance that I actually have simpsonitis? I mean,
      you said that the test was not 100% accurate.” Dr. Kalvakian
      replies, “Well, there’s a 98% chance that you have the
        disease, Bart.”</p>
      
      <p>Bart initially has a cow, but then he decides to tell the
      brainy Lisa what Dr. Kalvakian said. What do you suppose Lisa
      told Bart in response?</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You’ve seen sine, cosine, and tangent before. In fact,
    you’ve even used them to find missing sides in triangles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you define the sine of $\theta $ ? Cosine of
      $\theta $ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use careful construction of a triangle to find $\sin {37^
      \circ }$.
      Do not use the sine function on your calculator!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why can’t you use a construction to find $\sin {102^
      \circ }$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even though we can’t construct a triangle to find the sine
    of ${102^ \circ }$, your
    calculator can tell you an approximate value! In this lesson,
    we will discover
    a new way to think about sine and cosine—a way that makes
    calculating the
    values of $\sin {102^ \circ }$, $\cos 1002^\circ$, and $\tan \left( { -
    {{10002}^ \circ }} \right)$ possible.</p>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>Most of the problems in this section require carefully drawn
    diagrams.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A wheel of radius one foot is placed so that its center is
      at the origin, and a pin on the rim is at (1, 0). The diagram
      below shows the wheel after it has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction.









</p>
 
<p><figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/07-1-circular-functions/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
  </figure></p>

<p>      Now consider the function $P(\theta )$, which outputs
      the
      coordinates of the pin after the wheel has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction. So, for
      example, $P({0^\circ})=(1,0)$ and $P({270^\circ})=(0, - 1)$.
      Find $P(\theta )$ when:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {90^ \circ }$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {45^ \circ }$. Give an
      exact answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {30^\circ}$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {57^\circ}$

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta $ is some measure between
      ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$. (Your answer should be expressed in
      terms of $\theta $.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For values of ${\theta ^{}}$ between ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$, how are $\cos \theta $ and
      $P(\theta )$ related?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, let’s consider angles greater than ${90^\circ}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calculate $P(150^\circ)$, with P being the same
      position function as in question 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $P(253^\circ)$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Compare these values to the sine
      and cosine of $150^\circ$ and $253^\circ$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using the diagram and your
      calculations, what do you think the tangent of $253^\circ$ is? The
      tangent of $150^\circ$? Check them on your calculator.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It is the convention for rotations that motion in a
    counterclockwise direction
      is considered <em class="vocab">positive</em>, while motion in a clockwise direction
    is considered
      <em class="vocab">negative</em>. So if our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ counterclockwise we would
    input $57^\circ$
    in our function $P(\theta )$, as we did in problem 1, but if
    our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ clockwise we would input $–57^\circ$ in our
    function $P(\theta )$. So the output for would be the
    coordinates of the pin after the wheel is spun $57^\circ$
    clockwise.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 240^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 2640^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 237^\circ )$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - \theta )$, where $0^\circ

      function which outputs the coordinates of the pin after this
      larger wheel has been spun an angle ${\theta ^{}}$ in a

      <p class="problem-part">What is $Q(48^\circ )$?</p>

Getting Comfortable With Trig 
</h1>

  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In an earlier lesson, you learned how the trigonometric
    functions sine, cosine, and tangent were defined for angles
    other than those between 0 and 90 degrees. Here is a quick
    refresher.</p>

    <p>Imagine sitting at the edge of a merry-go-round with radius
    1 meter. You’ve set up a coordinate system with (0,0) at the
    center of the merry-go-round, and the point (1,0) is due east
    from (0,0). When the wheel starts to turn counterclockwise,
    your position is (1,0).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $42^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/merry-go-round 42 degrees.png">
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $200^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">This may be enough to remind you of the generalized
    definitions of sine and cosine. In the figure below, a “spoke”
    of a circle of radius 1 is drawn so that it makes a central
    angle of $\theta $ with the positive $x$-axis. The spoke
      intercepts the circle at the point $(x,y)$. The <em class="vocab">sine</em> of an
      angle $\theta $ is the $y$-coordinate of this point. The <em class="vocab">cosine</em>
    of $\theta $ is the $x$-coordinate of this point.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%202.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the figure above, how would you define the tangent
      of $\theta $?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In middle school, you learned that $\sin \theta $ is
      defined as $\frac{\text{length of the side opposite } \theta \text{ in a right triangle}}{\text{length of the hypotenuse}}$. Where is the right triangle in the figure above,
      and what are the opposite and hypotenuse?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you determine the sine, cosine, and tangent of
      an angle using a circle with a different radius than 1?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The circle with radius one is better known in mathematical
    circles as the “unit circle.” You’ll want to draw it — or a
    circle with a well-chosen radius — almost every time you solve
    a trig problem.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Cecilia is on a Ferris wheel and notices that, when she
      has rotated about 143 degrees from due east, she is 24 meters
      west and 18
      meters above the center of the wheel. Use this information
      to
      approximate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 143 degrees.
      Then
      see how you did by asking your calculator for these
      values.</p>

    <p>Problem 2 may have reminded you that whether the sine or
    cosine of an angle is positive or negative depends on which
      <em class="vocab">quadrant</em> the angle is in. This allows you to answer questions
    like the following.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go back to your 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles and think
      about positioning them on the unit circle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      sine of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      cosine of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      tangent of 1.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now explain how to find <em>all</em> the
      angles that have a sine
      of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the equation $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$. How many
      solutions are there? How many solutions are interestingly
      different from one another?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Of course, you might also have to solve equations that don’t
    involve sines
    or cosines of angles in special triangles. For instance, if you
    had to solve $\sin \theta = .2531,$ you would be forced to
    resort to the inverse sine function on
    your calculator.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make sure your calculator is in degree mode, then take the
      inverse sine of .2531 to solve this equation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw the “wheel” again, and draw a spoke at the angle that
      has sine .2531. Remembering that the sine of an angle is the
      height of a point above the $x$-axis, indicate the other point
      on the wheel that would have the same sine.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you calculate the size of this second angle with
      sine .2531? Do so.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Further
    Development</h2>

    <p>You’re used to measuring temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
    but you also know that much of the world measures temperature
    using degrees Celsius. Similarly, the world uses miles and
    kilometers, ounces and grams, gallons and liters.</p>

    <p>When the Babylonians invented degree measure, they chose a
    360-degree circle for two reasons. One was that, since there
    are 365 days in a year, a degree would be very close to one
    day’s progress around the circular path they believed the sun
    made every year. Another reason is that 360 is divisible by
    lots of numbers, so
    we can describe a fourth, a sixth, an eighth, and a tenth of a
    circle as an integer number of degrees. (Try this with a 100
    degree circle and you’ll see it doesn’t work as well.)</p>

    <p>As time went on, though, mathematicians realized that the
    number 360 didn’t
    really have anything to do with circles, and in fact some of
    their calculations would be easier if they used a different
    system. This system was inspired by the close relationship
    between a central angle of a circle and the arc it intercepts.
    It was also inspired by the importance of the unit circle.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%2023.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Specifically, we’d like the measure of a central angle in
    the unit circle to be literally the same as the length of the
    arc it intercepts.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the circumference of the unit circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since a 360 degree “central angle” intercepts the entire
    circle your answer to Problem 24 will be the equivalent of 360
    degrees in our new system.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How much of a circle does a 180 degree central angle
      intercept? So, in this new system, how should we represent a
      180 degree angle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Under this new system, what should we call the measure of
      an angle that intercepts a quarter-circle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What should we call the measure of an angle that
      intercepts
      a sixth of a circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you measure angles this way, you are measuring in
      <em class="vocab">radians</em>. (Try pressing the MODE button on your calculator and
    notice that there is a radian vs. degree option.) The next
    problems suggest a reason for the name.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many times does the radius of a circle “fit” around
      the circumference? (Hint: remember that the circumference of
      a circle is $C = 2\pi r$.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Say you have an angle that intercepts an arc on the unit
      circle equal to two of its radii. How many radians is that
      angle?</p>
      
      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/two radians.png">
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p>If you are about to solve an equation like $\sin \theta = \dfrac {\sqrt {3}} {2}$, you might not
    know whether to give your answer in degrees or radians. Your
    class should agree on which system to use.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h4>The Leaning Tower of Pisa</h4>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/diagram%201.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p class="Lesson---Narrative-text">The Leaning Tower of Pisa
    has been leaning almost since the onset of construction in
    1173. From ground to top, the tower is 183.27 ft along the
    lowest side and 186.02 ft along the highest side. The angle of
    slant of the tower—formed by its shorter slant height and the
    ground—is ${95.5^ \circ }$. An apocryphal tale states that
    Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), an Italian physicist,
    mathematician, and philosopher, dropped two cannon balls of
    different weights from the top of this leaning tower in trying
    to demonstrate that the descending speed of a falling body is
    independent of its weight.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the distance traveled by an object dropped from the
    top of the Tower of Pisa, on its lowest side, when it hits the
    ground?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the horizontal distance from the point where the
    object hits the ground to the base of the tower?</p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="new-page">The Tower of Pisa first acquired a slant after the third
    floor was built in 1178. More recently, in 1990, it was closed
    to the public because of safety fears. In fact, the tower was
    on the verge of collapse, and it was projected that it would
    have collapsed between 2030 and 2040. However, it has been
    straightened a bit, but still remains slanted (the tower has
    been reopened to the public). Thus, the angle of slant of the
    Tower of Pisa, $\alpha $, has been changing for centuries. The
    following is a sketch of the situation.</p>

    <p>In trying to determine a general expression for the
    distance, $h$, traveled by an object dropped from the top of the

    found the following expression.</p>

    <p>We follow the convention of labeling the angles of a
    triangle using capital letters, and the lengths of the
    corresponding opposite sides with the corresponding lower-case
    letters. For example, we may label A, B, C the angles of the
    triangle, and a, b, c the corresponding opposite sides, as in
    the figure below.</p>

    <h4>The Bermuda Triangle</h4>

    <p>The “Bermuda Triangle” or “Devil’s Triangle” is an imaginary
    area located off the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United
    States of America, which is noted for a supposedly high
    incidence of unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft.
    The vertices of the triangle are generally believed to be
    Bermuda, Miami (Florida), and San Juan (Puerto Rico).

    </figure>
    
    <p>One of the amazing stories from this triangle tells that an
    aircraft (A in the figure below) was 747.23 miles from the
    airport of Miami (M in the figure), on the line joining Miami
    and Bermuda, when its crew received an SOS signal from Cyclops
    (C in the figure), a ship located at a point on the line
    joining Miami airport and San Juan, which was sinking. Flight
    controllers at the airport were able to estimate the measure of
    $\angle AMC$ to be ${52^ \circ }$.</p>

      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Based on the previous story, Mr. Thomas Howard designed a
    problem for his mathematics class. The initial situation
    described in the story, however, contained more than the
    minimal information required to solve the problem; therefore,
    he divided the class into two groups, Group I and Group II, and
    gave each group a problem with different pieces of information,
    but the same goal to determine how many miles the aircraft had
    to travel through the purportedly dangerous Bermuda Triangle
    before reaching Cyclops.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group I: Besides the general information described above, it
    is known that $m\angle C = {60^ \circ }$. What is the distance

    solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at your

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group II: Besides the original and general information, it
    is known that the distance from Cyclops to the airport of Miami
    is 800 miles, as shown in the figure below. What is the
    distance between the aircraft A and the sinking ship Cyclops C?
    Find a solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at
    your answer.</p>

    Consider the more general triangle below.</p>

    <p class="new-page">In group II, Rebecca noticed that if the measure of $\angle
    M$ were ${90^ \circ }$ rather than ${52^ \circ }$, the
    Pythagorean Theorem would guarantee that ${m^2} = {a^2} +
    {c^2}$. “However,” she said, “since $\angle M$ is less than
    ${90^ \circ }$, the Pythagorean relationship among $m$, $a$, and $c$
    must be adjusted.” This adjustment is the result that you are
    about to find in Part c of the following problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Consider the triangle in Mr. Howard’s problem in a more

    <p>As announced above, the expression relating $m$ with $c$, $a$, and

    the adjustment to the Pythagorean relationship ${m^2} = {a^2} +

    similar way, adjustments to the Pythagorean relationship
    relating $a$ to $m$ and $c$ as well as to that relating $c$ to $a$ and $m$
    may be needed when either $m\angle A$ or $m\angle C$ is not

    <h2>Further Development</h2>

    <p>When the students in Mr. Howard’s class shared their
    findings (the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines) the
    information contained in these laws was considered “the key” to
    find missing side lengths or angles in any triangle, when basic
    information about the triangle is known. However, in reality in
    all the proofs only acute triangles—triangles with each of
    their three angles being less than ${90^ \circ }$—were
    used.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Regarding Mr. Howard’s problem, consider the following
    situation where $m\angle M = {142^ \circ }$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/image52.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Does the proof of the Law
    of Sines (in Problem 7), or that of the Law of Cosines (in
    Problems 8 and 9), support the use of either of these laws to
    find $m$ in this triangle, which is not an acute triangle?

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The graph of the sine and cosine functions are very
    distinctive looking.</p>

      
      
    
    <figure class="fig-50 two-up">
    <img src="../images/10-2-modeling-with-trig/Lesson%202%20-%20graph%20intro%201.tif.jpg" >

  </figure>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Which of the figures above is $y = \sin x$? Which is $y =
      \cos x$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using your knowledge of trigonometry, find coordinates for
      a few of the high and low points for each graph, and of the
        places they cross the <nobr>$x$-axis.</nobr></p>
    </div>

    <p>Though you’re used to using trigonometry to find missing
    angles and lengths in diagrams, the special shape of the graph
    of the sine and cosine functions make them very useful in
    modeling as well. Graphs that have a shape similar to that of a
      sine curve are called <em class="vocab">sinusoidal</em> (even if they involve the
    cosine instead of the sine).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with some situations in which a graph with the
      characteristics of a sine or cosine curve would provide a
      good model.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In general, sine and cosine curves are used to model
      situations that are <em class="vocab">periodic</em>
    – that have some repeating pattern. (You might be familiar with
    this word from the periodic table, which is a chart of elements
    arranged so that, every time you begin a new row in the chart,
    the elements begin to repeat the same pattern of
    characteristics that was established in the previous row.) Sine
    and cosine functions are examples of periodic functions, and
    the distance you
    need to go on the $x$-axis before the values of the functions
      begin to repeat themselves is called the <em class="vocab">period</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the period of the sine function? How about the
      period of the cosine?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you are using radians, what is the period of each
      function?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Not all situations that are periodic will have the same
    period. Nor will all be the usual sine or cosine graphs. For
    example, one situation that lends itself well to trigonometric
    modeling is the depth of a lake at a fixed location,
    measured over time as the tide comes in and out. Here is a
    graph of some
    data for a particular lake. $D \left ( x \right )$ measures the depth of the water in
    inches
    at time $x$ hours after midnight.</p>

     <figure class="fig">
    <img src="../images/10-2-modeling-with-trig/Lesson%202%20-%20graph%205.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Though the shape of $D(x)$ is similar to that of a sine
    or cosine curve, clearly its equation is not $y = \sin x$ or
    $y = \cos x$. However, we can get the equation for this
    graph by doing various transformations of sine and cosine
    curves, much like we can take the graph of $y = {x^2}$ and
    use transformations to turn it into any parabola we choose. In
    order to figure out how to take a curve like $y = \sin x$ or
    $y = \cos x$ and turn it into the curve above, we’ll <em class="vocab">take
      things apart</em> by looking at each of the transformations
    separately.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s first think about how we could change the period of a
    sine or cosine curve.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What type of transformation would changing the period be —
      a vertical stretch, vertical shift, horizontal stretch, or
      horizontal shift?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Suppose we wanted to cut the period of the sine function in
    half — make it $180^\circ$ instead of $360^\circ$. In other words, the sine
    function starts to repeat itself after $360^\circ$, but we want
    to find a different function that repeats itself after $180^\circ$. And put a third way (!) a partial table of values for
    the sine function looks like this …</p>

    <table id="table-1" class="Basic-Table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>$x$</p>

      <p>Now try to find a formula for a function like the one
      above, except it has a period of $90^\circ$. Now find one with a
      period of $720^\circ$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In terms of $n$, what is the period of the function $y =
      \sin nx$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p class="problem-part"> Write an equation for a function related to the sine
      function that has period P.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Does your idea work for cosine as
      well? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>See if you can write an equation for a function that has
      the same period as the function in the tide example. You
      could pick either sine or cosine… for consistency, let’s use
      cosine.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In addition to the change in period, the tide function
    differs from the sine
    and cosine functions in other ways. For one thing, it is
    vertically stretched as compared to those functions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the height of the usual cosine function, $y = \cos
      x$, measured from the $x$-axis to its highest point?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many times its normal height do you need to stretch a
      cosine curve in order to get the same height as the curve for
      the depth of water function, $D(x)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Conjecture an equation for a cosine-based function that
      would be vertically stretched by the right amount. If you’ve
      done it right and also changed the period, the graph of your
      function should be exactly the same shape as $D(x)$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The <em class="vocab">amplitude</em> of a sine or cosine curve is defined as <em>half</em> the vertical distance from the top to the bottom of the curve.
    This was the quantity you found in Problem 12.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why do you suppose the amplitude is defined as <em>half</em> the
      distance, rather than the entire distance from top to
      bottom?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the amplitude of $f(x) = \sin x$? What’s the
      amplitude
      of $D(x)$ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation for a sinusoid curve that has amplitude
      A.</p>
    </div>

    <p>At this point, our graph has the right shape; we just need
    to translate it over to the right location. This is something
    you learned how to do when studying quadratics, though if
    you’ve forgotten, try experimenting with your calculator when
    answering the next few questions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>By how much do we need to vertically shift the graph?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation for a graph with the same period,
      amplitude, and vertical shift as $D(x)$ (again using
      cosine).</p>
    </div>

    <p>We could make this graph coincide perfectly with $D(x)$
    by shifting it
    horizontally.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>To remind yourself how to do a horizontal shift, first try
      writing equations that shift the graph of $y = {x^2}$ three
      units to the right, then three units to the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now use the same technique to shift the graph of $y = \cos
      x$ by 90 degrees to the right, then 90 degrees to
      the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>It’s not obvious how to do a horizontal shift at the same
      time that you change the period of a graph. First make a
      sketch of $y = \cos 90x$. Then write an equation that you
      could use to shift this graph two units to the right. Check by
      using your calculator to graph your equation, and refine your
      equation if necessary.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the required horizontal shift needed to turn
      your graph in Problem 19 into the graph of $D(x)$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now that you have all the tools, write an equation for
      $D(x)$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Having this model allows us to make predictions. For
    example ...</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use your equation for $D(x)$ to predict the depth of
        the water at <nobr>10:15 pm.</nobr></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In previous lessons, you may have used exponential, logarithmic,
    and power functions to model data. For instance, if you had evidence that the data could
    be modeled by an exponential function, then your task was to
    find values for $a$ and $b$ in the function type $f(x) = a{b^x}$.
    However, one problem in the Exponential Functions lesson involved a kind of exponential
    function for which it wouldn’t work simply to find $a$ and $b$. A 180$^\circ$ cup of coffee is left out to cool in a 70$^\circ$ room.
    Below is a graph showing the temperature of the coffee over time.</p>
    
   <figure>
      <img src="../images/10-5-making-new-functions/Lesson 5 - intro graph.tif.jpg">
    </figure>
    
    <p>A function that does a decent job of modeling this data is
    $f(x) = 99.5{(.895)^x} + 71.$ You can think of the function as
    a translation
    of 71 units up of the more familiar function $g(x) =
    99.5{(.895)^x}$.</p>

    <p>It’s easy to imagine changing the vertical shift of $g$ in
    order to produce lots of different functions, perhaps
    corresponding to cooling curves in rooms of different
    temperatures. More generally, in modeling data it’s useful to
    be able to start with basic function types and use
    transformations in order to control the shape and position of
    those graphs. We will begin our study of this technique by
    examining more abstract types of functions.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Below is a graph of a function $f$. Note that $f$ is not one of
    the function types you have studied before. It does not have a
    nice formula. But its graph is still enough for you to answer
    questions about input and output.</p>

    <p>Note that we say “a table of values” “might” look like this
    because there are far more points on the graph of this
    function. If you wanted to, you could use $x = 3.5$ in the
    table, or even $x = \pi $. The dashes in the table are
    there because the function is not defined for certain inputs:
    specifically, for $x &lt; 2$ and $x &gt; 7$. Another way of
      saying this is that the <em class="vocab">domain</em> of the function is $2 \le x \le

    <p>The following exercise illustrates another way to combine
    functions, known as <em class="vocab">composition</em> of functions. Composition is
    when you “chain” two functions together, by taking the output
    of one function and using it as the input to a second function.
    To see why this might be useful, consider the following
    situation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Howie is chewing Super-Bubble gum and blows a super-bubble.
      The radius (in inches) of his bubble increases with time (in
      milliseconds) in a way given by the equation $r(t) = 2t^{0.25}$. What is the
      volume of Howie’s bubble 5
      milliseconds after he blows it?

</p>
</div>

    <p>In order to solve the previous problem, you had to do two
    things. First, you had to find the radius of the bubble at 5
    milliseconds. Then you had to use the radius you found in order
    to find the volume of the bubble. In function language, if $V$ is
    the familiar function $V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi {r^3}$ giving the
    volume of the bubble in terms of the radius, then you first
    found $r(5)$, and then found $V(r(5))$.</p>

      (continuation of problem 17) When tribbles first appear on
      the Enterprise, there are four tribbles, collectively
      squeaking at a noise level of 6 decibels. Five hours after
      they appear on the Enterprise, there are 30 tribbles,
      squeaking at a noise level of 45 decibels.

    sine” function for years, but thinking about it now, you can
    see that the sine function does not have an inverse! There are
    many ways to get an output of 1: when $x$ is 90°, 270°, 450°, etc
    if you are working in degrees, or when x is $\frac{\pi }{2}$,
    $\frac{{3\pi }}{2}$, $\frac{{5\pi }}{2}$, etc if you are
    working in radians. Thus, if someone says, “find ${\sin ^{ -
    1}}1$,” you wouldn’t know which of the values listed above to
    give in response.</p>

    <p class="No-Paragraph-Style">The reason we can still talk
    about the inverse sine function is that we are thinking about
    only a limited set of inputs (angles) that you can plug in to

      Trigonometric functions are not the only common functions
      that require a domain restriction in order to take their
      inverse. $f(x) = {x^2}$ does not have an inverse because for
      a given output, like 4, there are multiple inputs, -2 and 2,
      that produce that output. However, if you restrict the domain
      of $f$ to allow only values of $x$ greater than or equal to zero,
      then the function has an inverse. You can think of the square
      root function as the inverse of $f(x) = {x^2}$ on this
      restricted domain.

      <p>You might recall from Physics class that Newton’s 2nd Law
      of Motion tells us that the net force on an object divided by
      its mass equals its acceleration, i.e., $a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}$. Let’s look at the
      case of a person pushing a bobsled and its passengers on the
      ice.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If the mass of the bobsled and
    passengers is 300 kg and the person pushes so that there is a
    net force of 900 Newtons on the bobsled, what is the
    acceleration of the bobsled (the units are in
    meters/sec$^{2}$)?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> If the net force on the
    bobsled is tripled, does the acceleration triple?</p>

 	<p class="problem-part"> If, instead, the net force
    remained at 900 N but the mass of the bobsled and passengers
    was tripled from part a, what would happen to the
    acceleration?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> What would be the effect on
    the acceleration of tripling the net force and the mass from
    part a at the same time?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What would happen to the
    acceleration if the net force were the same as part a, but the
    mass of the bobsled and passengers was cut in half?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Finally, what would be the
    effect on the acceleration if one both doubled the net force
    from part a and halved the mass at the same time?</p>

    <p>The types of relationships between variables that you have
    been exploring in the previous problems are special cases of
    two broad categories: direct proportionality and inverse
    proportionality.</p>

    <p>$y$ is <em class="vocab">directly proportional</em> to $x$ when $y = kx$, where $x$
    and $y$ are variables and $k$ is a constant not equal to 0. Another
      way of saying this is that $y$ <em class="vocab">varies directly</em> with $x$. For
    example, in problem 2, where $C = 2\pi r$, we say that $C$ is
    directly proportional to $r$, or that $C$ varies directly with
    $r$.</p>

    <p>$y$ is <em class="vocab">inversely proportional</em> to $x$ when $y = \frac{k}{x}$,
    where $x$ and $y$ are variables and $k$ is a constant not equal to 0.
      Another way of saying this is that $y$ <em class="vocab">varies inversely</em> (or
      <em class="vocab">indirectly</em>) with $x$. For example, in problem 1c, where $a =
    \frac{{900}}{m}$, we say that $a$ is inversely proportional to
    $m$, or that $a$ varies inversely with $m$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Answer the following questions by using the definitions of
      direct and inverse proportionality given above.</p>

      <p>Biologists have determined a good approximation of the

      defined as the velocity at which an object travels the most

      analogy is with cars, where the most fuel efficient speed to

      <p>“The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman!” was a campy “sci-fi”
      thriller from the 1950’s, about a woman who, due to an alien
      encounter, grows to be a 50 ft giant, wreaking havoc on the
      metropolis she lives in. Could humans prosper at such heights
      if, say, our DNA gave our body permission to “keep growing”?
      Let’s check it out.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Here are two important facts: 1)
      The weight of any animal is directly proportional to its
      volume, and 2) The strength of a bone is directly
      proportional to the cross-sectional area of the bone. Write
      equations that represent these relationships.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A 50 ft woman is 10 times taller
      than a <br>5 ft woman, indicating that one could roughly think
      of her as a 5 ft woman scaled up by a factor of 10 in all
      dimensions. How many times more would the 50 ft woman weigh
      than the <br>5 ft woman?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Since all dimensions are scaled by
      a factor of 10, how many times stronger would the 50ft.
      woman’s bones be than the 5 ft woman’s?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Bones in the leg break if they are
      under too much strain/pressure, that is, if there is too much
      weight above pressing down on the bones. Using your answers
      to parts b and c, determine how the pressure (i.e.
      $\frac{{{\rm{Weight}}}}{{{\rm{Cross - sectional \ area}}}}$
      of the leg bones) on the 50ft woman’s leg bones compares to
      the 5 ft woman’s.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Thus explain why animals that are
      small would have difficulty if they grew too large, even
      given that their DNA permitted it. That is, why aren’t there
      50 ft women?</p>

      <p>The speed on a given planet with which an object must be
      propelled from its surface straight up so that it would never
      come down is called its escape velocity,
      determined by the equation <nobr>${v_{esc}} = \sqrt
        {\frac{{2GM}}{R}} $,</nobr> where ${v_{esc}}$ is the escape
      velocity in meters/second, $G$ is a fixed constant, and $M$ and $R$
      are the mass and radius of the planet in kilograms and
      meters.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The <em class="vocab">escape velocity</em> on the surface
      of the Earth is 11,200 meters/second (you can see why we need
      rockets to achieve such velocities). If the Earth were twice
      as massive but the same size, what would the escape velocity
      then be? How many times more massive would the earth have to
      be for the escape velocity to be twice what it is now?</p>

      <p>The pressure exerted by an object A on another object B is
      directly proportional to A’s mass and inversely proportional

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Physics tells us that an object falling in a vacuum will,
      because of gravity, get faster and faster — there’s no limit
      on its top speed as it falls. In practice, though, the
        Earth’s atmosphere causes <em class="vocab">drag</em>. Because of this, a falling
      object (like, say a skydiver) will initially speed up, but
        eventually will reach its <em class="vocab">terminal velocity</em> — its constant
      top speed, where the drag force perfectly cancels out
        gravity, so that there’s no more acceleration.</p><p>
      According to Wikipedia, the square of the terminal velocity
      of an object is directly proportional to its mass and
      inversely
      proportional to its cross-sectional area.</p>

      <p>Suppose you dropped two spherical balls, both made of
      identical material, from an airplane.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If the radius of the larger of the
      two balls is sixteen times the radius of the smaller, then
      which ball has a higher terminal velocity? How many times
      faster is it than the other one?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If, instead, the larger of the two
      balls weighs twice as much as the smaller, then which ball
      has the higher terminal velocity? How many times faster is it
      than the other one?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now suppose that two balls, this
        time made of <em>different</em> materials, turn out to have the same
      terminal velocity. If the radius of the larger ball is twice
      the radius of the smaller, then which ball is made of a
      denser material? How do their densities compare? (Note:
      density = mass/volume.)</p>

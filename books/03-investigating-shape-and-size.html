    <p>When you have a diagram, it is sometimes helpful to <em class="vocab">Fill
    in all the Information you Can</em>, even if you think it has
    nothing to do with the problem you have to solve. This is
    another example of <em class="vocab">tinkering</em>. Doing this will help you to see
    patterns and to notice things about the diagram that you
    might not have noticed otherwise. It is a wonderful thing to
    do when you are stuck on a problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>The radius of the smallest circle is one unit. What is
        the ratio of
        the area of the largest circle to the area of the smallest
        circle?</p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/03-0-geometric-tinkering/Image88825.PNG" >
        </figure>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class='new-page'>In the problem on the previous page, rather than trying to figure out the
    ratio of the two areas immediately, it makes more sense to
    figure out some smaller, manageable thing about the figure,
    and see where that leads us. A clear place to start is with
    the smallest circle. Once we find the area of that circle, we
    can then find the square that surrounds it. Can we then find
    the area of the second largest circle? By looking at the
    smallest parts, we can see the pattern which allows us to
    solve the original problem.</p>

    <p>In your previous experience with geometry, you probably
    learned some basic facts about angles, lines, and triangles.
    For instance, two angles that form a line add up to 180
    degrees, and so do the three angles of a triangle. You may
    also know that, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite
    the sides that are the same length are also the same. These
    facts will help you with many of the problems that
    follow.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Thales of Miletus (625-547 B.C.) is generally regarded as
    the first of the Seven Wise Men of antiquity. Among other
    things, he is known for having calculated the height of the
    Great Pyramid in Egypt using the length of its shadow when
    compared to a stick in the ground and its shadow at the same
    time of the day.</p>

    </figure>
    
  

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Inspired by Thales’ method, Robert and Mary calculated the
      height of a tree. At a certain time of day, Robert stood at a
      point such that the tip of his shadow coincided with the tip
      of the tree’s shadow. Then they measured both the shadow of
      Robert, who is 1.8 m tall, and the shadow of the tree. They
      found that Robert’s shadow was 4.32 m and the tree’s shadow
      was 18 m long. With this information they were able to
      calculate the height of the tree to be 7.5 m. Could you
      explain how they might have found the height of the tree?</p>

      <p><em class="vocab">Taking things apart</em> in the figure in Problem 1, we have
      two triangles. One right triangle whose legs are the tree and
      its shadow, and another right triangle whose legs are Robert
      and his shadow (see figure below). What can you conjecture
      about the angles in these two triangles? Explain your
      answer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Kristi is sitting in the back seat of her parents’ car,
      driving from Omaha, NE to visit her grandparents in
      Hastings.
        The scale on her map is <nobr>1 inch = 20 miles.</nobr> She’s using a
      Bazooka gum wrapper, which she knows is 1.5 inches long, to
      estimate distances.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">When leaving her parents’ garage,
      Kristi first opens the map, she notices that there are about
      five gum wrapper lengths from Omaha to Hastings. How many
      miles will her trip be?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many “gum wrapper lengths” will
      Kristi measure between her position on the map and Hastings
      if she is 100 miles away from Hastings?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Much later in the trip, Kristi
      notices that the distance remaining on the map is about a
      third of a gum wrapper. How many miles are remaining?</p>

      <p>In Baltimore, Maryland, Union Memorial Hospital is the
      largest building in the triangular region bounded by E
      University Pkwy, N Calvert St, and E 33rd St (the higher on
      the map below). If the Union Memorial Hospital’s left side,
      the side on N Calvert St, is 250 meters long, use the map
      below to estimate the other two side lengths of this
      triangular region. You can either measure with a ruler or
      measure with some other object, like Kristi.</p>

    <p class="new-page">In Middle School, you may have learned how to scale down (or
    up) a figure.
    In fact, you may now realize that in doing dilations or
    contractions, you are changing the scale of a figure. When you
    scale a figure by a factor of $r$, your
    new figure will have lengths $r$ times the corresponding lengths
    of the original
    figure. This can also be expressed by saying that the sides of
    the second figure are <em class="vocab">proportional</em> to the corresponding sides
    of the first figure by a factor of $r$. In this case, we say as
    well that the second figure is a <em class="vocab">scaled copy</em> of the first
    figure by a factor of $r$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Below there are some pairs of figures. In Part b, the

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Triangle $\triangle DEF$ is the image of under a dilation centered at the
      origin $O\left( {0,0} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ scaled copies of

      <p class="problem-part">How are the angles of triangle $\triangle ABC$
        related to the angles of <nobr>$\triangle DEF$?</nobr> Explain.</p>
    </div>


    <p>In our study of dilations, you may have noticed that the
    angles of the image of a figure under a dilation have the same
    measurements as the corresponding angles of the original
    figure. What’s more, you can see in Problem 7 that the
    following relationship holds:</p>

    <p>side length of image = (scale factor) $\cdot$ (side length of corresponding side in
    original figure)</p>

    <p>The next two problems use the important vocabulary word
    <em class="vocab">congruent</em>. Two angles are congruent if they have the same
    measure, just as two line segments are congruent if they have
    the same length.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Discuss the following statement with the members of your
      group.</p>
      <p>“If the three angles of a
      triangle are congruent to the three angles of a second
      triangle, then the triangles are scaled copies of each
      other.”</p>
      <p>If you disagree, give a
        counterexample showing that this statement is false.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now examine the following statement.</p>
      <p>“If two angles of a
      triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, then
      the triangles are scaled copies of each other.”</p>
      <p>If you disagree, give a
      counterexample showing that this statement is false.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The word <em class="vocab">similar</em> is used in mathematics to describe two
    triangles that are scaled copies of each other. Similarity
    plays an important role in the design of large or small objects
    such as automobiles, airplanes, or integrated circuits. As a
    matter of fact, before building an automobile, engineers sketch
    out scale drawings and use them to build scale models which
    they then use to run tests. Also, as we saw in the introduction
    of this section, Thales of Miletus may have used similar
    triangles to calculate the height of the Great Pyramid in
    Egypt, more than 2500 years ago. Similarity is thus a
    mathematical instrument that allows us to zoom in or zoom out
    when examining the physical world.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Thus far, you have discovered several features of similar
      triangles.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Why does it make sense to use the
      word “similar” to describe two triangles that are scaled
      copies of each other?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If two triangles are similar, how
      are their angles related? How are their sides related?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If you are given a $\triangle ABC$, describe a
      procedure for drawing a $\triangle A'B'C'$ similar to it.</p>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <p>In many of the problems that follow, you will see a
    convention that will be used throughout your high school
    career. If two angles are marked with arcs that are the same
    style (both bold, or double instead of single), that means
    those angles are congruent.</p>

    <h2>Further Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Jasmine has two triangles with equal angle
      measurements.</p>

      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/03-1-similar-triangles/image37.jpg" >
      </figure>
      <p>
      The sides of one triangle are 4, 6, and 8. <br>The sides of the
      other are 9, 6, 12. <br>She says that the triangles are not
      scaled copies because:
      
      $$\frac{4}{9} = 0.444..., \textrm{  } \frac{6}{6}=1, \textrm{  and  }\frac{8}{{12}} =
      0.666...$$</p>
      <p>Do you agree with Jasmine? Thoroughly explain your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In two similar triangles, angles with the same measure are
    called <em class="vocab">corresponding
      angles</em>, and sides opposite corresponding angles are called
    <em class="vocab">corresponding sides</em>. As a matter of fact, in the previous
    problem, $\angle A$ and $\angle R$ are
    corresponding angles, and $\overline {BC}$ and $\overline {PQ}$ 
    are corresponding sides. Given
    misunderstandings such as that of Jasmine’s in the previous
    problem, it is
    important to state explicitly what pair of angles have the same
    measurement when describing similar triangles. A natural way of
    doing this is by listing their corresponding angles in the same
    order. Thus, regarding the triangles in the previous exercise,
    we say that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle RQP$ are similar, and write $\triangle ABC \sim \triangle RQP$. The symbol $\sim $ is read “is similar to.”</p>

    <div class="problem">

      <p class="problem-part">List all pairs of corresponding
      sides.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Let $k$ be the scale factor, that is,
      the lengths of the sides of $\triangle DEF$ are $k$ times the lengths of the
      corresponding sides of $\triangle ABC$. So, for example, $AB = k\cdot ED$. <br><br>Write two more equations
      involving $k$, each one using a different pair of sides.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Solve each of the three equations for
      $k$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">In part c, you should have found
      three quantities that all equal $k$. Translate this into a
      statement about side lengths
      in similar triangles.</p>

    <p>
    In the previous problem you may have concluded that if $\triangle DEF \sim \triangle ABC$,
    then</p>

    <p>$$\dfrac{{DE}}{{AB}} = \dfrac{{EF}}{{BC}} =
    \dfrac{{FD}}{{CA}}$$</p>

    <p>These equalities are also used to express that in two
    similar triangles corresponding sides are proportional. These
    equalities allow us to relate corresponding sides of similar
    triangles without explicitly mentioning the scale factor.

      point on the wall about 3/8 of an inch to the right of the
      dot. Later Felipe (carefully) looks at the center of the Sun,
      which is 93 million miles away. If he looks at a sunspot that
      is .1 degrees to the right, how far away from the center of
      the Sun will he be looking? Would you estimate it was
      about:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">16 miles to the right</p>

      <p class="problem-part">160,000 miles to the right</p>

      <p class="problem-part">16,000,000 miles to the right?</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The escalator at the Wheaton metro station in Silver Spring,
    Maryland, is the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere.
    If you ride it you will travel a diagonal distance of 508 feet,
    which will take two minutes and forty-five seconds. You’re
    about to build a bigger one – your goal is to make an escalator
    with a diagonal distance of 520 feet. Before you can start,
    though, you need to do some planning. You need to figure out
    how much space along the ground your escalator will take so
    that you can prepare the foundation. Standard escalator
    construction rules require that:</p>
    
    <ul class="bulleted">
      <li>the steps each be 1.2 feet long<br><br>.</li>
      <li>The measure of the angle between the ground and the
      diagonal path of the escalator must be no more than 30°</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/The%20Wheaton%20Escalator.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You start to build your escalator and measure a diagonal
      distance of 1.3856 feet per step. What is the horizontal
      distance, along the ground, you’ll need to clear in order to
      build your escalator with a diagonal distance of 520
      feet?</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Your solution to the escalator problem probably involved
    ratios or scale factors in some way. Here’s one way of thinking
    about the problem:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you haven’t already, explain how you know that
      $\frac{1.2}{1.3856} = \frac{\textrm{the required horizontal distance}}{520}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use a similar method to find the height of the Wheaton
      escalator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Imagine a large right triangle $ABC$ with the right angle at
      $A$ and angle $C = {30^ \circ }$. Based on your work in
      problems 1-3:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What would you expect the ratio of
      $AC$ to $BC$ to be? Why?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about the ratio of $AB$ to
      $BC$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Go ahead and check your thinking by
      using a protractor and ruler to accurately draw such a
      triangle, and measure the sides. Convince yourself that these
      ratios are the same no matter how large or small the right
      triangle is, provided the measure of angle $C$ remains
      30°.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As problem 4 emphasizes, certain ratios will always stay
    constant in a right triangle with an angle measuring 30°. In
    the escalator example, the ratio of the vertical distance to
    the diagonal distance is called the <em class="vocab">sine</em> of 30°. The ratio of
    the horizontal distance to the diagonal distance is called the
    <em class="vocab">cosine</em> of 30°.</p>

    <p>A third ratio is called the <em class="vocab">tangent</em> ratio. In the escalator
    example, this is the ratio of the vertical distance to the
    horizontal distance.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you asked your calculator to tell you the sine of 30°
      what do you suppose it would give you? How about the cosine
      of 30°? Tangent of 30°?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you think of the escalator as a triangle with a 30° angle and a 90° angle, you can label the sides as
    follows:</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/Intro Trig image after problem 5.png">
    </figure>

    <p>There are two sides that form the 30° angle. One is of
    course the <em class="vocab">hypotenuse</em>; the other is called the side <em class="vocab">adjacent</em> to
    the 30° angle. The vertical side of the triangle is called
    the side <em class="vocab">opposite</em> to the 30° angle, since it is all the way
    across the triangle from the angle.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each of the following, use a protractor to draw a
      RIGHT triangle with the angle given. Then use a ruler to
      measure the lengths and calculate the sine, cosine, and
      tangent of each angle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">25°</p>

      <p class="problem-part">63°</p>

      <p class="problem-part">42°</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each part in the previous problem, use the SIN, COS,
      and TAN buttons on your calculator to see how close your
      estimates were.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s the picture in general. We’re using $\theta$ (“theta”) to
    stand for any angle, just like we can use $x$ to stand for any
    number.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/intro%20trig%20def%20triangle.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>If $\theta$ is an angle in a right triangle, but not the right
    angle, then here’s how we define the three trigonometric
    ratios:</p>

    $$\sin(\theta)= \frac{\textrm{opposite}}{\textrm{hypotenuse}}$$

    $$\cos(\theta)= \frac{\textrm{adjacent}}{\textrm{hypotenuse}}$$

    $$\tan(\theta)= \frac{\textrm{opposite}}{\textrm{adjacent}}$$

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the two triangles below, find the sine, cosine, and
      tangent of a 70° angle, a 20° angle, a 35° angle, and a 55°
      angle.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Did you notice any repeated answers in your calculations
      above?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make a conjecture based on your
      findings.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Try out your conjecture on a
      triangle that you create.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you explain why this is going
      on?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the similar triangles lesson, and also in the escalator
    problem, you were able to find missing lengths in certain
    triangles because you had a second, similar triangle that
    allowed you to find the scale factor. One reason that sine,
    cosine, and tangent ratios are so important is that they help
    you find lengths in triangles even when you don’t have a second
    triangle to help you get the scale factor.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here is a problem that allows you to “solve a triangle”
      using only trigonometry.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use this triangle to write an
      expression for the tangent of
      35 degrees. Your expression will, of course, contain the
      letter $x$.</p>

      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/10.png" >
      </figure>
      
      <p class="problem-part">Using the equation “$\tan {35^ \circ
      } = ...$”, find $x$. (You should know the value of $\tan
      35^\circ $ from a previous problem)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find the length of the hypotenuse of
      the triangle.</p>

    </div>

    <p>In the previous problem, you were lucky that you already
    knew the tangent of 35°. You are not always so lucky.
    However, your calculator can help you out.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Press the MODE button on your calculator and make sure
      “degree” is selected. Then type “tan(35)”. The number on your
      screen should look familiar.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find both of the missing sides in the following
      triangle:</p>

      </figure>
    </div>


    <p class>Often, trigonometry is used to find lengths of triangles in
    the “real world” that are too difficult to measure
    directly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You’d like to know how tall a flagpole is, but you can’t
      reach the top to measure it. So instead you use your tape
      measure to measure 50 ft along the ground. Standing 50 ft
      away from the flagpole, you can see the top of the flagpole
      by looking up at a 22° angle. How tall is the flagpole?</p>
      <figure>
        <img src="../images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/intro%20trig%20flagpole2.tif.jpg" >
      </figure>
    </div>


    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the previous problem, you might have ignored your
      height. Say your eyes are at a level of 5 feet 6 inches above
      the ground. Taking this into account, figure out how tall the
      flagpole <em>really</em> is.</p>

    <p class="new-column">Your calculator gives you approximate answers when you ask

Trig And Shapes

  <section class="development">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>So far, the trigonometry that you’ve learned applies
    specifically to right triangles. Even with shapes you see
    around you that don’t look like right triangles, with a little
    creativity you can still analyze these shapes using right
    triangles.</p>

    <p>An “octastar” is a perfectly regular eight-pointed star.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find two different ways to split up the octastar into
      right triangles.</p>

      </figure>

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s a regular pentagon with each side measuring 2
      inches.</p>
      <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure3.png" >
      </figure>
      <p class="problem-part">Find the measure of each angle of the
      pentagon by first drawing a circle around the pentagon. (You
      might want to use the center of the circle.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Let’s split this pentagon into six
      right triangles. (You can assume that the lines that look
      vertical and horizontal are vertical and horizontal.) Fill in
      all the angles that you can figure out in the new diagram.</p>
      
      <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure4.png" >
      </figure>

      <p class="problem-part">Now that you have all the angles,
      what more do you need to find in order to calculate the area of
      the pentagon? (Saying what you need to find is enough… you
      don’t need to actually calculate the area.)</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>In the diagrams so far, every drawing has been split up by
    turning it into a collection of right triangles pieced together
    – in other words, you add up the triangles to get the picture
    you want. Here’s a slightly different way to use that strategy.
    Suppose you’re investigating the following triangle:</p>

    <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure5.png" >
    </figure>

    <p class="new-page">You could split it into two right triangles by adding the
    following line:</p>

    <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/Figure6.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>But suppose for some reason you didn’t want to split up the
    long side of the triangle. Instead, you might notice that if
    you add a small right triangle on to your diagram, you get a
    big right triangle:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/add on small right triangle.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>One strategy to think about when you <em class="vocab">visualize</em> a problem is
    that you can alter the diagram to see it in a new way. Finding
    a new way to see a picture, or figuring out an interesting way
    to split a diagram into pieces, can give you insight into the
    problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the diagram below a circle is fitted exactly into a
      square. The center of the circle is O and the length of
      diameter AB is 3.5 cm. What is the area of the square?</p>

      <p>Split each of these three identical triangles into two
      right triangles, each in a different way.</p>

      </figure>

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The line segments you used to split the triangles in
        problem 5 are called <strong>altitudes</strong>.</p>

    are asked to estimate an answer.</p>

    <h3 class="new-page">Inverse Trigonometry</h3>

    <p>So far, given the right information, you have been able to
    find the length of sides of a triangle, and might well wonder
    if there might be a way to find the angles when the appropriate
    information has been given. For example, could you find the
    angle at the top of the right triangle below? You could take a
    guess, check your result, and refine your guess.</p>

    <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/03-3-trig-and-shapes/image017.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make a guess. Think about how you could test your guess
      for accuracy, given what you know about sines (or cosines).
      Test it and adjust your guess until you get the correct
      answer to the nearest degree.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are ways to figure out the trigonometry of every angle
    exactly, but when you type “sin 67”, for example, into your
    calculator, it is basically looking the answer up on a table:
    sin 67° is about .9205.</p>

    <p>Now suppose you know that an angle has a sine of .9205, but
    you don’t remember the degree measure of the angle. You can try
    to figure out the angle, as you did in problem 10 above, using
    reasoning. Or, you can use your calculator to look at the sine
    table, backwards – this is like asking “The sine of what angle
    would give me .9205?”</p>

    <p>To do this, first make sure your calculator is set in degree
    mode. Then, type
      <nobr>“$\sin^{-1}.9205$”</nobr> into your calculator. This asks your calculator to give you an
    angle whose sine is .9205. You will get an answer of
    about 66.999°. (Notice that the answer we got is a tiny bit
    different from the angle we started with – this is because
    .9205 is rounded.) Your calculator has “$\cos^{-1}$” and “$\tan^{-1}$”
    buttons as well.</p>

    <p>When you have a diagram, it is sometimes helpful to <em class="vocab">Fill
    in all the Information you Can</em>, even if you think it has
    nothing to do with the problem you have to solve. This is
    another example of <em class="vocab">tinkering</em>. Doing this will help you to see
    patterns and to notice things about the diagram that you
    might not have noticed otherwise. It is a wonderful thing to
    do when you are stuck on a problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>The radius of the smallest circle is one unit. What is
        the ratio of
        the area of the largest circle to the area of the smallest
        circle?</p>
        <figure>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p class='new-page'>In the problem on the previous page, rather than trying to figure out the
    ratio of the two areas immediately, it makes more sense to
    figure out some smaller, manageable thing about the figure,
    and see where that leads us. A clear place to start is with
    the smallest circle. Once we find the area of that circle, we
    can then find the square that surrounds it. Can we then find
    the area of the second largest circle? By looking at the
    smallest parts, we can see the pattern which allows us to
    solve the original problem.</p>

    <p>In your previous experience with geometry, you probably
    learned some basic facts about angles, lines, and triangles.
    For instance, two angles that form a line add up to 180
    degrees, and so do the three angles of a triangle. You may
    also know that, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite
    the sides that are the same length are also the same. These
    facts will help you with many of the problems that
    follow.</p>

      <p>Socrates, the Ancient Greek philosopher, was known for
      being a trickster. One day, Socrates claimed to have a
      triangle whose lengths were 5, 8, and 10. He also said that
      two of the angles in the triangle were ${50^ \circ }$ and
      ${27^ \circ }$ .<br>

      <p>Andrew decides to measure the height of a tree by using an
      idea he learned in class. He takes two poles—one 10 feet long
      and the other 14 feet long—and walks up to a very tall tree.
      He places the 14-ft tall pole to the side, walks with the
      10-ft pole straight out 36 feet from the tree and plants the
      pole so that it is parallel to the tree. He then walks along
      the same line father away from the tree until the
      line-of-sight from the ground to the top of the 10-ft pole
      intersects with the top of the tree. He marks this spot on
      the ground and measures from it to the base of the 10-ft
      pole. This distance is 6 feet. He then takes the other
      pole—the 14-ft one—and walks in the opposite direction from
      the 10-ft pole until he’s 40 feet from the tree. He plants
      the 14-ft pole so that it is parallel to the tree. He then
      walks along the same line farther away from the tree until
      the line-of-sight from the ground to the top of the 14-ft
      pole lines up with the top of the tree. He marks this spot on
      the ground and measures from it to the base of the 14-ft
      pole. This distance is $d$ feet. (You’ll notice that I’m not
      telling you what this distance is. Heh, heh, heh!) Assume the
      ground is level throughout the entire area that
      Andrew is measuring.</p>

      situation and all of the key measurements.</p>

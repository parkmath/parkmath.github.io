<article>
  <section class="development">
      <p>Looking at a large or complex problem can be fairly
      intimidating — where does one begin? It can seem that there
      is too much to take in all at once. Indeed, trying to
      understand the “whole” is often completely unhelpful at
      first, and we are better off just getting a handle on
      individual “parts” that make up the “whole”. To Take Things
      Apart is to break a problem down into smaller, more
      manageable “chunks” that we can understand. After we have
      solved the smaller problems, then we can use our results to
      rebuild the original problem and solve it.</p>

    <div class="problem">
        <div class="problem-content">
        	<p>You put a rubber band around a 3x5 “grid” of
        	circles.
        	Each circle has radius 1.</p>
          
          	<p class="Habits---Inline-Diagram"><img src="../images/05-0-take-things-apart/sphere%20packing.tif.jpg" ></p>

            <p class="problem-part">What is the length of the rubber
            band?</p>

            <p class="problem-part">What percent of the area inside the
            rubber band is not
            contained in any circle?</p>
        </div>  
      </div>

      

      <p class="new-page">
      We don’t have a name for the shape we’re trying to find the
      perimeter of in part a — it looks like a rectangle, but it
      has rounded corners. But we can still find the perimeter by
      breaking the shape up into pieces. For instance, we can start
      by finding the lengths of the parts of the sides that are
      straight — how long are they? It may help to draw some lines
      to section off this part of the shape for which you already
      have the perimeter. Now look at the part of the shape that’s
      left. Can you figure out how to get the remaining
      perimeter?</p>

      <p>Now all that remains is to break the problem down into
      steps in order to figure out what to do. First let’s think
      about how to find a percentage of area. That’s going to be
      $\frac{{{\rm{The\: area\: inside\: the\: rubber\: band\: but\: not\: in\: the\:
      circles}}}}{{{\rm{The\: area\: inside\: the\: rubber\: band}}}}$. This
      fraction
      
      tells us that we need to break this problem into two parts:
      find the numerator and find the denominator. To get the
      denominator, we might be able to use a “take things apart”
      process similar to our method in part a. To get the
      numerator, you will also need to come up with a plan.</p>

      <div class="problem">
        <div class="problem-content">
        	<p>How many triangles are there whose three vertices are
       	 	points on
        	this 3 by 3 square grid? (Math Counts)</p>
       
        	<figure class = "fig-25">
          		<img src="../images/05-0-take-things-apart/Count the triangles in the dots.png">
        	</figure>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p class="new-page">If you tackle this problem simply by drawing different
      triangles within the diagram, you might find yourself getting
      lost. In fact, all the overlapping triangles might lead you
      to think that you’ve found all of the triangles (when you
      probably haven’t), or you might just give up in the confusion
      of lines. So, one suggestion is to systematically take the
      diagram apart. First, look at the top-left square of points.
      How many triangles are there in this square? Now, how many of
      these squares exist in the 3 by 3 grid? So, how many
      triangles are there in the 3 by 3 grid that are of the form
      that fit into the top-left square?</p>

      <p>Now let’s look for more triangles. Instead of using
      a square, expand your boundary shape to a 2x3
      rectangle. Draw all the possible triangles that fit within
      the rectangle, excluding the ones you’ve already counted as
      part of a square. Now you can again multiply your answer by
      the number of rectangles that occur in the grid. Should you
      count overlapping rectangles or not?</p>

      <p>Now, complete the problem by counting the rest
      of the triangles. While this problem takes some effort at
      solving, it certainly takes less effort if you take the
      diagram apart and build up the count in
      a step-by-step fashion. What’s more, counting

        far too complicated to
        even approach. For example, to solve</p>

          households throw out every year?</p>
        
        
        <p>You might start with a quantity that is easier for you to
        reasonably estimate: the weight of the trash that your
        family throws out in a given week. (If it is your job to
        take the garbage out, you may be especially well-qualified
        to answer this question.) From there, you could reason from
        other well-known facts and reasonable guesses to scale up
          your answer to cover all U.S. households.</p>
        
        </p>These next few problems can similarly be solved by breaking

    members. Today, he has his Alabama map spread out over a table
    in the local coffee shop to determine the route he will drive with his
    pay-per-mile rental car. He has a cousin in Birmingham, grandparents in
    Huntsville, an aunt in Cottondale, and a brother in Tuscaloosa. When Felix
    realized that he’ll soon be served some of his grandma’s chicken
    liver-sardine-cranberry casserole, he gagged on his cappuccino and
    accidentally spilled the whole cup on his map. The only usable part of the
    map remaining is the mileage chart between cities. Here is the mileage
    between the relevant cities:</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>To determine Felix’s driving route, you probably recognized
    a way to represent the situation visually — whether you
    sketched out a map or drew a diagram.</p>

    <p>The second and third problems, however, didn’t have an
    obvious new representation
    to apply. Some people probably applied labels; others may have
    made lists. It turns out, though, if we use the method of the
    first problem with the second and third, we can learn much more
    from the data!</p>

    <p>Most likely, the diagram you used in the first problem was
    actually a graph. A graph, in its most general sense, is a
    collection of dots (called “nodes”) and lines connecting them
    (called “edges”). In your graph of Felix’s problem, the nodes
    represented cities, and the edges related the nodes by showing
    the distances between.</p>

    <p>We can represent the second situation with a graph, too, if
    we let each country be represented by a node. We can draw an
    edge between nodes when those countries border each other. Our
    graph comes out to look like this:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/mid%20east%20graph.png"
      alt="mid%20east%20graph.png">
    </figure>

    <p>The problem now becomes to color each dot in such a way that
    any two dots connected by lines are always different
    colors.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the minimum number of colors you need now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Did you think this version of the “coloring” problem was
      easier than in the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Similarly, we can represent the scheduling problem as a
    graph. The nodes can represent classes, and an edge can connect
    the nodes in the cases where some student wants to take both
    classes, as in the figure below.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/schedule%20planar.png"
      alt="schedule%20planar.png">
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the scheduling problem using this representation.
      What minimum number of blocks can you identify now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Was this version of the schedule problem easier than in
      the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The tools you have been using so far in this lesson are the
      tools of <em class="vocab">graph theory</em>.
    Already, graph theory has been über-useful in helping us
    represent relationships in a very streamlined way. What’s more,
    we can now see that the map-coloring problem and the scheduling
    problem — initially very different — are actually remarkably
    similar.</p>

    <p>In fact, the identically structured graphs of the
      map-coloring problem and the scheduling problem are <em class="vocab">isomorphic</em>.
    Two graphs are isomorphic when each node in one graph has a
    “partner” node in the other — a “partner” with the same
    connections. For example, Georgia in the first graph and
    Astronomy in the second correspond to one another. So do
    Lebanon and Advanced Calc. This correspondence comes from their
    identically structured connections, not their actual position
    on the page.</p>

    <p>The following two graphs are not isomorphic.<br></p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/Not isomporphic.png">
    </figure>

    <p>An easy way to see that the graphs are not isomorphic is to
    see that node B has no “partner.” In the left hand graph, B has
    three edges coming out of it. On the right, no node has three
    edges coming out of it, so B has no possible “partner.” The
    number of edges connected to a node is a very important
      characteristic. The <em class="vocab">degree</em> of a node (abbreviated deg(n)) is
    the number of edges coming out of it. So in the left-hand graph
    deg(A) = 1 and deg(B) = 3. What is deg(C)?</p>

    <p class="new-page">Isomorphisms can be trickier to spot than we’ve seen so far.
    For example, someone else with the task of drawing the
    scheduling graph might have come up with the following:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src=
      "../images/05-1-graph-theory/nonplanar schedule.jpg" alt=
      "nonplanar schedule.jpg">
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Check to see if this graph is still an accurate
      representation of the scheduling problem. Explain, in
      language a sixth-grader could understand, what you need to do
      to check if two graphs are isomorphic.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One final important concept that we will use is planarity.
    In the second
    version of the schedule graph, some edges crossed at places
    other than nodes. (For example, the edge connecting Animal
    Behavior to Shakespeare crosses the edge connecting Astro to
    Discrete.) In these cases, you can think of the edges passing
    under or over each other.</p>

    <p>Graphs where you don’t have to do this — where there is a
    way you can draw them without crossing the edges — are called
      <em class="vocab">planar</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why do you think the word “planar” might be used?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Note that a graph might be drawn with the edges crossing,
    and yet be isomorphic to a graph that is clearly planar, as in the following
    two graphs (with pairing 1-d, 2-a, 3-b, 4-c):</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/planar.png" alt=
      "planar.png">
    </figure>

    <p>In this case, we still say the first graph is planar because
    it can be drawn with no edges crossing and still represent the
    same information. Imagine picking up nodes 1 and 2, with their
    edges still attached, and “uncrossing” them to get something
    with the same shape as the second graph.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a nonplanar graph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find some degrees of nodes in the Middle East graph.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is deg(Saudi Arabia)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is deg(Syria)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What country’s node has the

      needed to adopt all of these cats?</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>As you learned last year, factoring a number means
    expressing it as the product of two or more other numbers. For
    example, 40 can be factored as $2 \cdot 20$. Of course, 40 can
    be factored in many other ways as well.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What are all the ways that 40 can be factored into two
      whole numbers?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since 20 can be factored as $4 \cdot 5$, 40 can also be factored into 3
    numbers as $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$; and since 4 can also be
    factored into $2 \cdot 2$, 40 can be factored into 4 numbers as $2 \cdot 2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 5$. You might also think of saying it could be
    factored into
    5 or 6 numbers as $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$ or $1
    \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, but since those
    aren’t really
    different from $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, we will agree that
    1 won’t “count” as a factor in the following problems, even
    though technically 1 is a factor of every number.
    Thus, at this point, 40 can’t be “broken down” any more than $2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$ (we are restricting ourselves to
    positive integers here, so we wouldn’t consider turning 5 into
    $2.5 \cdot 2$ or into $- 5 \cdot - 1$).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find two different ways to factor 72 into two positive
      integers. For each of your answers, continue factoring
      them until they can’t be “broken down” any more. Finally,
      rearrange each of your final factorings so that the factors
      are in order from smallest to largest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Factor 210 into the product of as many positive integers
      as possible. Compare your answer with a classmate’s. Based on
      this question and on question 2, what generalization might
      you now conjecture?</p>
    </div>

    <p>A number has been factored as much as possible when each of
    its individual factors cannot be broken down any more. Numbers
    greater than 1 that cannot be broken down any more (i.e.,
    cannot be factored into smaller positive integers) are called
      <em class="vocab">primes</em>. We say that the <em class="vocab">prime factorization</em> of 40 is $2 \cdot 2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, or ${2^3} \cdot 5$ for short; we know it is
    a prime factorization because all of the factors (2, 2, 2, and
    5) are primes. As suggested by questions 2 and 3, every
    positive integer greater than 1 has a unique prime
    factorization. As we will see, this uniqueness means that
    rewriting a number in its prime factored form will often be
    extremely useful, even though all we have done is written the
    same number in a different way.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it can be tricky to know what the factors of a
    number are: that is, what divides into it evenly, leaving no
    remainder. For example, what numbers is 153 divisible by? It
    would clearly be helpful if one knew easy procedures (known as
      <em class="vocab">divisibility tests</em>) that allowed one to see if smaller numbers
    divided arbitrary larger ones evenly. As a matter of fact, the
    divisibility tests for 2 and 5 are easy (what are they?), but
    it helps to know the tests for 3 and 11 as well (sadly, there
    is no easy test for 7).</p>

    <p>If, when you add up the digits of a number, its sum is
    divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3 as well; on
    the other hand, if the sum is not divisible by 3, the number is
    not divisible by 3. So 14353 is not divisible by 3 (because $1 + 4 + 3 + 5 + 3 = 16$, 
    which is not divisible by 3), while 55521 is. We will learn why
    the divisibility test for 3 is true later this chapter, but you
    might find it fun to ponder why it works on your own first!</p>

    <p>Some of you may remember learning in 9th grade that a number
    is divisible
    by 11 only when the “alternating sum” is divisible by 11. So
    4565 is divisible
    by 11 because is divisible by 11, as is 527494 because $+ 5 -
    2 + 7 - 4 + 9 - 4 = 11$, but 6587 is not because $+ 6 - 5 + 8
    - 7 = 2$
    is not divisible by 11.</p>

    <p>And now, a few problems to check your understanding of the
    above:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the largest number (other than 495 itself) that
      divides evenly into 495? Why do you know it’s the largest
      number that can do so?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is 4806 prime? How about 4807? Quickly name 5 numbers
      between 4800 and 4900 that are divisible by 11.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the prime factorization of 2310.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is 91 prime? How could you be sure of your answer?
      What about 221? Or 223?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a procedure that can determine, with
      reasonable efficiency, whether a number is prime or not.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Determining in general if a positive integer is prime (i.e.,
    has no factors other than itself and 1) turns out to be an
    increasingly difficult task the larger the
    number becomes. In fact, one of the most powerful ways of
    encrypting data
    on the internet — the so-called “RSA algorithm” — is based on
    the difficulty
    of finding the prime factorization of very large (over 100
    digits!) integers.</p>

    <p>Prime factorization also allows us to determine the answers
    to questions about the relationships between two (or more)
    numbers. Remember that it can be helpful to write the final
    prime factorization using powers; for example, the prime
    factorization of 484 is ${2^2} \cdot {11^2}$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the largest number that divides evenly into both
      216 and 270? This number is called the <em class="vocab">greatest common
        divisor</em> of the two numbers and is written as gcd(180, 156).
      (For example, gcd(24, 36) = 12, as 12 is the largest integer
      that “goes into” both 24 and 36.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If your answer to question 9 involved testing out a lot of
      different numbers, try writing out the prime factorization of
      each original number (i.e. 216 and 270) first and see if you
      can use them to be more efficient in finding their gcd.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find gcd(168, 448) efficiently. How can you be sure you
      have found the largest possible number that “works”?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find gcd(${2^{16}} \cdot {3^4}$, ${2^{13}} \cdot {3^8}$), or put another way, gcd(5308416, 53747712). Looking at the
      original prime
      factorizations of each number, what do you notice about the
      prime factorization of your answer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Create a procedure that allows one to efficiently
      determine the gcd of two positive integers. Check it with 3
      examples that you make up, where at least one of the examples
      is similar to problem 12 (i.e., where the two numbers are
      large but have simple prime factorizations).</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Crucially, then, a prime factorization is important because
    all the factors of a number derive from the number’s prime
    factors. 24, for example, is ${2^3} \cdot 3$,
    and all of its factors — 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 — are made
    up of combinations of the 2’s and 3’s found in the prime
    factorization.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the following exercises, learn how powerful prime
      factorization is by solving them without your calculator!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How can you check to see if $32
      \cdot 35$ equals $28 \cdot 40$ without determining either
      product?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Juniper says that when she
      multiplies $6 \cdot 24 \cdot 55$ it is equal to $21 \cdot x$, where $x$ is an integer. Explain if she is telling the truth
      or not.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Simplify $\frac{{64 \cdot 25 \cdot
      14 \cdot 33}}{{28 \cdot 44 \cdot 15}}$ as much as
      possible.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the positive integer N for
      which ${22^2} \times {55^2} = {10^2} \times {N^2}$?<br>

      <p class="problem-part">Is ${6^4} \cdot {10^3}$ greater
      than, less than, or equal to ${8^2} \cdot {15^3} \cdot 6$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last few problems also are a reminder of the <em class="vocab">laws of
      exponents</em> that you learned in middle school. Since ${5^6}$ is
    just $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5$ and ${5^4}$ is
    just $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5$,
    it makes sense that</p>

    <p>$\begin{array}{c} {5^6} \cdot {5^4} = (5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5) \cdot (5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)\\ =
    {5^{10}} \end{array}$</p>

    <p>Similarly, because $\frac{{{5^6}}}{{{5^4}}}$ is just
    $\frac{{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}}{{5 \cdot 5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5}}$, it makes sense that some pairs of 5’s in
    the numerator and denominator would “cancel” (because
      $\frac{5}{5} = 1$) and thus<br> 
      $\frac{{{5^6}}}{{{5^4}}} = \frac{5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{5
      \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}$<br> 
      $= \frac{5
    \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot 5}{\cancel5
    \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5 \cdot \cancel5}$<br> 
      $= 5^2.$</p>

    <p>Lastly, ${({5^4})^3}$ is just $(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)(5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)$, so
    ${({5^4})^3} = {5^{12}}$.</p>

      each side to the 1/3 power: ${\left( {{x^3}}
      \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}} = {11^{\frac{1}{3}}}$, the idea being
      that because the exponents on the left side multiply, the
      exponent becomes “1”, and so it simplifies to $x =
      {11^{\frac{1}{3}}}$ (or $\sqrt[3]{{11}}$).

      <p>Let’s take a look at a proof the Greek mathematician

      that there were a finite number of primes, and then showed

      self-contradictory. Follow along to see his “moves”!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If there were a finite number of

      clearly how one could calculate $“Q”$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Euclid then made his biggest
      “move”. Remembering that all the primes divide evenly into
      $“Q”$, Euclid asks us to consider the number $Q + 1$. Which of
      the primes do you think would go evenly into $Q + 1$ as well?

    <h2>And Now For Something Completely Different—
    A Mindreading Textbook!</h2>

    <p>Don’t believe it? Try this!</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick a number, any number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 4 to it.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Square your new number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Subtract 16 from your answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Divide what you have by the
      original number you picked.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Finally, subtract the original
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">This textbook knows what you got as
      your answer for Part e, and in fact it predicted ahead of
      time what you were going to get. Oh, you don’t believe it?
      Check out Part g.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Why should I tell you? You think
      I’m a liar. Oh, alright, I’ll tell you, but only if you
      promise to be impressed. See part h for enlightenment.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">I’ll tell you, not that you deserve
      it. Your answer to Part e is…(drum roll please)…eight. Now
      then, kiddo, never doubt a talking textbook again.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>You may have seen a trick like the one above before and
    wondered how it worked. Let’s look at a few of them and see if
    we can figure out how they “tick”.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Have a friend pick a number without telling it to you, and
      then, keeping their calculations to themselves, ask your
      friend to:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 8 to it.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now multiply by 3.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Subtract 11.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply by 2.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Finally, have them divide by 6 and
      tell you the answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">From their answer to Part f, you
      can now figure out their original number and impress the
      socks off of them. How? Try out your solution with a
      classmate and see if it works.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s figure out what happened in Problem 2 by using
      algebra. Let’s call the original number your friend was
      thinking of “$x$”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What number would they have after
      adding 8 to their
      original number?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">And after multiplying by 3?
      Remember to use parentheses!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about after subtracting 11?
      Simplify your answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">After multiplying by 2 and adding 4
      and simplifying, what expression do you have?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now divide your answer in Part d by
      6, and simplify your
      answer again. Remember that with fractions, $\frac{{a +
      b}}{c} = \frac{a}{c} + \frac{b}{c}.$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">So, given your answer in Part e,
      how can you determine your friend’s original number?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s a trickier one. Think of the age of anyone you
      know.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply it by 10.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 1.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply by 2.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 21.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply by 5.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Your answer to Part e will end in
      the two digits “15”.
      Remove those last two digits to get a new number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Subtract 1 from the new number, and
      that is the age you were thinking of. Why?
      (Hint if you’re having trouble: What you did in Part f can
      also be thought of as a subtraction followed by a
      division—how so?)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s a more difficult variation. Pick a positive
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Three less than that number,
      multiplied by two more than that number is…</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now take your answer from Part a
      and add the original number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Add 6 more.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take the square root. Ta da! Why
      does this work?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Figuring out Problem 5 required that you understand how to
    multiply two
    expressions together like $\left( {x - 3} \right)\left( {x + 2}
    \right)$—you use the distributive law and
    then combine “like” terms. Here, then, we get</p>

    <p>${x^2} + 2x - 3x - 6 = {x^2} - x - 6$.</p>

    <p>Recall that like terms are those that have the same power of
    $x$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Take two 2-digit numbers, Betty and Crocker.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Divide Betty by Crocker. (i.e.
      $\frac{{{\rm{Betty}}}}{{{\rm{Crocker}}}}$)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Raise your answer to the 4th power,
      and then square the result. Call this “Vanilla”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, instead, divide Crocker by
      Betty.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Cube what you got, and then cube it
      again. Call this
      “Chocolate”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply “Vanilla” times
      “Chocolate”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Multiply your answer in Part e by
      Betty. What do you get?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Instead, divide your answer in Part
      e by Crocker, and then take the reciprocal. Now what do you
      get?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Explain the mystery of the
      universe’s existence, or at least Parts f and g.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s go back to Problem 1, the introductory problem.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calling the original number $x$,
      represent what “happens” to the number algebraically in each
      step.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">To understand why the trick works,
      we have to simplify
      the complicated expression obtained in Part a. The first two
      steps produces ${\left( {x + 4} \right)^2}$; how can this
      expression be simplified? Check with an individual value of x
      to see if your simplification is plausible. Remember,
      ${\left( {x + 4} \right)^2} = \left( {x + 4} \right)\left( {x
      + 4} \right)$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">After the 3rd and 4th steps, you
      should have $\frac{{\left( {{x^2} + 8x} \right)}}{x}$. This
      can be simplified by factoring the numerator. Do so.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Just as $\frac{{6 \cdot 13}}{6}$ can be simplified by realizing that $\frac{6}{6} = 1$ and
      that we can thus cancel out the 6’s, leaving just 13, the
      same is true with $x$’s and $y$’s. For example, $\frac{{y\left(
      {x - 5} \right)}}{y}$ is just $x - 5$, and $\frac{{{w^5}(x +
      w)}}{{{w^5}(x + 7)}}$ is just $\frac{{(x + w)}}{{(x + 7)}}$.
      Now further simplify your answer to Part c.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">After the next and final step, you
      should now understand the “trick”! To check your
      understanding, construct a similar problem where the first
      two steps are to subtract 5 from the number and then squaring
      the result, and the final step yields the original number.
      (No square rooting allowed!!)</p>

      <p>After having completed and digested the ideas of Problems
      44 and 45, we are now ready to understand why the

      test for 3 states that if the sum of the digits of a number
      is divisible by 3, then the number itself is as well. (You

      <p>Pick a 3-digit number. If one subtracts the “reverse” of

      multiple of 9 (and negative numbers “work” as well — e.g. If
      we had picked $258, \ 258 - 852 = -594$). Explain why this is so. (Remember that
      any three digit number “ABC” can be written as $100{\rm{A}} +

    <h2>Introduction: Hey batta! Hey batta!</h2>

    <p>Jan bats .500 in softball — i.e., on average, for each 10
    at-bats she gets five hits. We wish to determine the
    probability that she will get no hits if she comes to bat 5
    times during a game. In order to calculate this probability we
    must assume that she stays a “.500 hitter” from one at-bat to
    the next, which is to say that success or failure at each
    at-bat is not affected by the previous at-bats. Given this
      assumption we can perform the following calculation: </p>

      <p>Probability of no hits in 5 at-bats = $ \frac{\text {number of ways of getting no hits in 5 at-bats}}{\text {number of possible outcomes in 5 at-bats}}$<br>
      = $\frac{1}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2}$<br>
      = $0.03125$  
    </p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the probability that Jan will get exactly one hit
      in 5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 4 hits in
      5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 2
      hits?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last question probably took some time to calculate since
    there are 10 different ways for Jan to get exactly 2 hits. For
    example, one string of at-bats might look like HNHNN, where H =
    “hit” and N = “no hit”. Imagine trying to calculate the
    probability that Jan would get exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats.
    Don’t do this by listing all the strings of 10 at-bats with 3
    hits. You will be cursing by the end of this process, if not
    earlier. Fortunately, there is a more elegant way of counting
    how many strings have exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats. Let’s look
    at one approach.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>This approach will require us, first, to review two basic
    counting principles that you learned last year. Suppose you’re
    setting up a password for a new account.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      then how many possible passwords are there? The password is
      not case-sensitive so there’s no distinction between “a” and
      “A”.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      but no letter or digit can be repeated, then how many
      passwords are there? Again, the passwords are not
      case-sensitive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 10 digits, no letters, with no
      repetition, then how many passwords are there? There’s a nice
      shorthand way of writing this answer. Do you remember it?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The problems above involve a basic principle of counting
      called the <em class="vocab">Multiplication Principle of Counting</em>. You also
    needed to pay attention to whether repetition mattered. Lastly,
    Problem 6 alludes to some shorthand notation that comes in
    handy when the final count gets very large. Keep in mind that
    this is only notation and doesn’t solve problems for you. As
    you progress through this lesson, you’ll need to remember that
    the formulas you might derive are not all-purpose ones that
    solve counting problems. They tend to work in highly
    specialized situations. You will find more success if you read
    each problem carefully, think about what is being counted
    (visualize, even), and then apply basic principles like the
    Multiplication Principle of Counting. Now, let’s see how to
    tackle the batting problem by looking at a similar problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The word <em>error</em> has 5 letters in it, two letters that
      appear once and one that appears three times. We’re going to
      look at different 5-letter “words” that can be formed by
      rearranging these 5 letters. These words need not make any
      sense, so “rroer” is a word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many 5-letter words can be
      formed, assuming that you can tell the difference between the
      $r$’s? In other words, think of the $r$’s as being a red $r$, a
      blue $r$, and a green $r$ (or as ${r_1}$, ${r_2}$, and ${r_3}$). By the way, each of the letters can only be used once per
      word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write down two 5-letter words that
      differ from each other only if the $r$’s are different colors.
      How many other 5-letter words differ from these two only if
      the $r$’s are different colors?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Think of another 5-letter word that
      is different from the ones in Part b. How many versions are
      there of this
      5-letter word that are distinguishable from each other
      only
      if the $r$’s are different colors? Would all of these 5-letter
      words be part of the count you made in Part a?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">So, how many 5-letter words can be
        formed by rearranging the letters in <em>error</em>, if each letter
      can only be used once per word (and the $r$’s are
      indistinguishable from each other)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Lastly, you should be able to write
      your answer to Part d in the form $\frac{5!}{n!}$. What is $n$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
        the letters in <em>freestone</em>, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
        the letters in <em>freewheel</em>, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
        the letters in <em>appraisal</em>, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the letters H, H, H, H, H, N, N, N, N, N, N, N only,
      how many 12-letter words can be formed? (Note: though the
      word “distinguishable” is not appearing you should
      assume you are just counting words that are different from
      each other.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the previous problems you were always counting letters.
    If you think about what you were doing, however, you should
    realize that the method of counting wasn’t dependent on
    letters. Problem 11, for example, could have initially been a
    problem about how many ways can you step right five times and
    left seven times in a sequence of twelve steps.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Bill is flipping a coin 8 times, keeping track of the
      sequence of heads and tails. What is the probability that
      he’ll get
      exactly 5 heads in total? Exactly 4 heads? 3 heads?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Alix’s mathematics class wants to form a committee of 4
      students to investigate whether AP classes should be taught
      in the school. If there are 16 students in the class then how
      many different committees can be formed?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last problem may have seemed quite different from the
    previous ones, but there is a way of seeing it as no different.
    Imagine that you’re working with all 16 students and that you
    have 16 Velcro labels. Twelve of these labels are a large N and
    four of them are a large Y. You line the 16 students up and
    then try to count how many different ways you can assign the
    labels to the students. In this sense, you are trying to
    determine how many different ways you can arrange 12 N’s and 4
    Y’s in a sequence.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The answer to the last sentence (and to Problem 13) can be
      written in the form $\frac{{a!}}{{b!{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} c!}}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ have specific meanings
      in the context of the problem. What are $a$, $b$, and $c$ and what
      are their meanings?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The fraction in Problem 14 can be simplified so that there
      is only one factorial expression in the denominator. Do
      this.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Look back at your answer to Problem 15 and remember that
    this fraction is an answer to Problem 13. Now, use your
    understanding of the relationship between this fraction and
    Alix’s committee problem to answer the following question.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You’re going to order a triple-scoop bowl of ice
      cream.
      If you plan on choosing three different types of ice cream
      from 8 possible choices, then how many different triple-scoop
      combinations are there?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this lesson you have seen some problems where two
    different orderings of the same things are to be thought of as
    being different — e.g., the passwords 3857210964 and
    6710892534. In other problems, you’ve had to discount these
    differences — e.g., the triple-scoop combination of
    chocolate-vanilla-pistachio does not differ from the
    combination pistachio-chocolate-vanilla. As you work through
    the remaining problems in these lessons, bear in mind these
    distinctions. Some problems will fall into one category and not
    the other, while some will fall into both. And, of course, some
    will fall into neither.</p>

      <p>Below is shown a triangle of dots. Suppose you start at
      dot A and move down through the triangle in the following
      manner: from any dot you can only move to the next dot that
      is down left or down right. So, if you are at dot A you can
      move to either dots B or C, but not directly to D or E. Below
      each dot in the triangle write the number of distinct paths
      from dot A to that dot.</p>

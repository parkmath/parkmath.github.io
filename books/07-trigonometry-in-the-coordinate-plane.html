      <p>Often a problem that can seem particularly
      perplexing can be solved by looking at it in a
      different way. Sometimes the best way to keep
      track of the different information and variables
      in a problem is to draw a picture of some sort,
        to <em class="vocab">visualize</em> the information so that it is in a form that is
      easier to understand. You saw this last year as you solved a
      variety of problems, at times by constructing models, and at
      times by finding clever ways to visually represent things
      that at first seemed quite nonvisual.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You’ve seen sine, cosine, and tangent before. In fact,
    you’ve even used them to find missing sides in triangles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you define the sine of $\theta $ ? Cosine of
      $\theta $ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use careful construction of a triangle to find $\sin {37^
      \circ }$.
      Do not use the sine function on your calculator!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why can’t you use a construction to find $\sin {102^
      \circ }$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Even though we can’t construct a triangle to find the sine
    of ${102^ \circ }$, your
    calculator can tell you an approximate value! In this lesson,
    we will discover
    a new way to think about sine and cosine—a way that makes
    calculating the
    values of $\sin {102^ \circ }$, $\cos 1002^\circ$, and $\tan \left( { -
    {{10002}^ \circ }} \right)$ possible.</p>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>Most of the problems in this section require carefully drawn
    diagrams.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A wheel of radius one foot is placed so that its center is
      at the origin, and a pin on the rim is at (1, 0). The diagram
      below shows the wheel after it has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction.









</p>
 
<p><figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/07-1-circular-functions/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
  </figure></p>

<p>      Now consider the function $P(\theta )$, which outputs
      the
      coordinates of the pin after the wheel has been spun an angle
      ${\theta ^{}}$ in a counterclockwise direction. So, for
      example, $P({0^\circ})=(1,0)$ and $P({270^\circ})=(0, - 1)$.
      Find $P(\theta )$ when:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {90^ \circ }$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {45^ \circ }$. Give an
      exact answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {30^\circ}$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta = {57^\circ}$

      <p class="problem-part">$\theta $ is some measure between
      ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$. (Your answer should be expressed in
      terms of $\theta $.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For values of ${\theta ^{}}$ between ${0^\circ}$ and ${90^\circ}$, how are $\cos \theta $ and
      $P(\theta )$ related?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, let’s consider angles greater than ${90^\circ}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calculate $P(150^\circ)$, with P being the same
      position function as in question 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $P(253^\circ)$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Compare these values to the sine
      and cosine of $150^\circ$ and $253^\circ$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using the diagram and your
      calculations, what do you think the tangent of $253^\circ$ is? The
      tangent of $150^\circ$? Check them on your calculator.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It is the convention for rotations that motion in a
    counterclockwise direction
      is considered <em class="vocab">positive</em>, while motion in a clockwise direction
    is considered
      <em class="vocab">negative</em>. So if our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ counterclockwise we would
    input $57^\circ$
    in our function $P(\theta )$, as we did in problem 1, but if
    our wheel is spun $57^\circ$ clockwise we would input $–57^\circ$ in our
    function $P(\theta )$. So the output for would be the
    coordinates of the pin after the wheel is spun $57^\circ$
    clockwise.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 240^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 2640^\circ )$. Give an exact
      answer.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - 237^\circ )$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\tan ( - 237^\circ )$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$P( - \theta )$, where $0^\circ
      &lt; \theta &lt; 90^\circ $. (Your answer should be

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $\cos \theta = - 0.4$.</p>

      true?</p>

      and $\sin ( - 10^\circ )$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s revisit question 4, but with a wheel of radius 7
      feet
      instead of 1 foot. The wheel is still centered at $(0,0)$,
      and still with a pin at $(7,0)$. Let $Q(\theta )$ be the
      function which outputs the coordinates of the pin after this
      larger wheel has been spun an angle ${\theta ^{}}$ in a
      counterclockwise direction.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $Q(48^\circ )$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $Q(109^\circ )$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you define sine and

    <h4>The Leaning Tower of Pisa</h4>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/diagram%201.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p class="Lesson---Narrative-text">The Leaning Tower of Pisa
    has been leaning almost since the onset of construction in
    1173. From ground to top, the tower is 183.27 ft along the
    lowest side and 186.02 ft along the highest side. The angle of
    slant of the tower—formed by its shorter slant height and the
    ground—is ${95.5^ \circ }$. An apocryphal tale states that
    Galileo Galilei (1564-1642), an Italian physicist,
    mathematician, and philosopher, dropped two cannon balls of
    different weights from the top of this leaning tower in trying
    to demonstrate that the descending speed of a falling body is
    independent of its weight.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the distance traveled by an object dropped from the
    top of the Tower of Pisa, on its lowest side, when it hits the
    ground?</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <p>What is the horizontal distance from the point where the
    object hits the ground to the base of the tower?</p>
    </div>
    
    <p class="new-page">The Tower of Pisa first acquired a slant after the third
    floor was built in 1178. More recently, in 1990, it was closed
    to the public because of safety fears. In fact, the tower was
    on the verge of collapse, and it was projected that it would
    have collapsed between 2030 and 2040. However, it has been
    straightened a bit, but still remains slanted (the tower has
    been reopened to the public). Thus, the angle of slant of the
    Tower of Pisa, $\alpha $, has been changing for centuries. The
    following is a sketch of the situation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>In trying to determine a general expression for the
    distance, $h$, traveled by an object dropped from the top of the
    Tower of Pisa’s lowest side when it hits the ground (assuming
    that the shorter length of the tower has not changed), Gerald
    found the following expression.</p>
      
      <div align="center"> ${h} = {183.27\sin \alpha}$ </div>
      
    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">For the horizontal
    distance from the point where the object hits the ground to the
    base of the tower, Gerald found the following expression.</p>

    <p>We follow the convention of labeling the angles of a
    triangle using capital letters, and the lengths of the
    corresponding opposite sides with the corresponding lower-case
    letters. For example, we may label A, B, C the angles of the
    triangle, and a, b, c the corresponding opposite sides, as in
    the figure below.</p>

    <h4>The Bermuda Triangle</h4>

    <p>The “Bermuda Triangle” or “Devil’s Triangle” is an imaginary
    area located off the southeastern Atlantic coast of the United
    States of America, which is noted for a supposedly high
    incidence of unexplained disappearances of ships and aircraft.
    The vertices of the triangle are generally believed to be
    Bermuda, Miami (Florida), and San Juan (Puerto Rico).
    </p>

      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/Bermuda%20Triangle.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>
    
    <p>One of the amazing stories from this triangle tells that an
    aircraft (A in the figure below) was 747.23 miles from the
    airport of Miami (M in the figure), on the line joining Miami
    and Bermuda, when its crew received an SOS signal from Cyclops
    (C in the figure), a ship located at a point on the line
    joining Miami airport and San Juan, which was sinking. Flight
    controllers at the airport were able to estimate the measure of
    $\angle AMC$ to be ${52^ \circ }$.</p>

      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Based on the previous story, Mr. Thomas Howard designed a
    problem for his mathematics class. The initial situation
    described in the story, however, contained more than the
    minimal information required to solve the problem; therefore,
    he divided the class into two groups, Group I and Group II, and
    gave each group a problem with different pieces of information,
    but the same goal to determine how many miles the aircraft had
    to travel through the purportedly dangerous Bermuda Triangle
    before reaching Cyclops.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group I: Besides the general information described above, it
    is known that $m\angle C = {60^ \circ }$. What is the distance
    between the aircraft A and the sinking ship Cyclops C? Find a
    solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at your

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Group II: Besides the original and general information, it
    is known that the distance from Cyclops to the airport of Miami
    is 800 miles, as shown in the figure below. What is the
    distance between the aircraft A and the sinking ship Cyclops C?
    Find a solution to this problem and explain how you arrived at
    your answer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>In Problem 5, if the distance given were m and the one to be
    found were c, the problem could be solved in a similar way.
    Consider the more general triangle below.</p>

    of the altitude from A to $\overline {MC} $, find h in $\Delta {ADM}$ in
    terms of $c$ and $\angle M$. Then find $\sin C$ in $\Delta {ADC}$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now, prove that ${\dfrac {m} {\sin M}} = {\dfrac {a} {\sin A}} \;$</p>

    <p class="new-page">In group II, Rebecca noticed that if the measure of $\angle
    M$ were ${90^ \circ }$ rather than ${52^ \circ }$, the
    Pythagorean Theorem would guarantee that ${m^2} = {a^2} +
    {c^2}$. “However,” she said, “since $\angle M$ is less than
    ${90^ \circ }$, the Pythagorean relationship among $m$, $a$, and $c$
    must be adjusted.” This adjustment is the result that you are
    about to find in Part c of the following problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Consider the triangle in Mr. Howard’s problem in a more
    general form, as shown below, and prove the following.</p>

    </div>
    
    <p>As announced above, the expression relating $m$ with $c$, $a$, and

    the adjustment to the Pythagorean relationship ${m^2} = {a^2} +

    similar way, adjustments to the Pythagorean relationship
    relating $a$ to $m$ and $c$ as well as to that relating $c$ to $a$ and $m$
    may be needed when either $m\angle A$ or $m\angle C$ is not

    <h2>Further Development</h2>

    <p>When the students in Mr. Howard’s class shared their
    findings (the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines) the
    information contained in these laws was considered “the key” to
    find missing side lengths or angles in any triangle, when basic
    information about the triangle is known. However, in reality in
    all the proofs only acute triangles—triangles with each of
    their three angles being less than ${90^ \circ }$—were
    used.</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <p>Regarding Mr. Howard’s problem, consider the following
    situation where $m\angle M = {142^ \circ }$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/07-2-law-of-sines-and-law-of-cosines/image52.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Does the proof of the Law
    of Sines (in Problem 7), or that of the Law of Cosines (in
    Problems 8 and 9), support the use of either of these laws to
    find $m$ in this triangle, which is not an acute triangle?

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Picture your favorite seat on a gently turning Ferris wheel,
    the hub of the wheel of a bicycle ridden along an undulating
    country road, that chip on the rim of the wheel of the old
    trolley as it hits the smooth flat road, or the middle rung of
    a ladder as the ladder slides down a wall and along the flat
    ground.</p>

    <p>These four familiar settings provide a peep into a very
    interesting concept in mathematics. In the first instance, you
    might have drawn a circle for the path of your favorite seat.
    Mathematicians would refer to this path as the locus (plural,
    loci) of the seat, and would perhaps state it more
    formally/awkwardly as follows:</p>

    <p>“The locus of the seat of the Ferris wheel is a circle whose
    center is the axis of the Ferris wheel and whose radius is
    equal to the distance from your seat to the axis.”</p>

    <p>So, in general, the <em class="vocab">locus</em> of an object or point is the graph
    of all the possible positions the object or point could occupy
    under certain restrictions. This is the focus of our lesson. We
    will try to describe loci in words as well as in equations
    where possible, as well as to recognize shapes represented by
    particular equations.</p>

    <p>[For this lesson you will need to have a protractor, ruler
    and compass.]</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>For each of problems 2 through 7 do the following:
    
    On a sheet of graph paper set up coordinate axes.
    Find a point which satisfies the stated condition, and label it
    $P$.
    Draw as many such points $P$ as you can.
    Decide whether these points form any particular shape. If so,
    describe that shape.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The $x$-coordinate of the point is 5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The point is always equidistant from the two points
      $A\left( {3, - 5} \right)$ and $B\left( { - 1, - 3}
      \right)$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The $x$-coordinate of the point is always less than or equal
      to the $y$-coordinate of the point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The distance of the point from the $x$-axis is always twice
      its distance from the $y$-axis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The distance from the point to the origin is always 6.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>First graph the points $M\left( {2,3} \right)$,
      $A\left( {6,3} \right)$ and $C\left( {2,7} \right)$. Now
      the restriction on a point $P$ is that the points $P$, $M$, $A$ and $C$
      must form a parallelogram. What is the locus of $P$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Remember, when you describe something, be sure that your
    description is complete. It should thoroughly cover every
    aspect of what’s being described.</p>

    <p>Your description should also be unambiguous. This means that
    it should be completely clear, and not open to any different
    interpretations. You should ask yourself, “Would it be possible
    for the reader to read my description carefully, but
    misunderstand what I mean?” If so, you know you need to be more
    specific.</p>

    <p>Finally, your description should be understandable to the
    intended reader.</p>

    <p>One could describe the locus of $P$ in problem 3 as the <em class="vocab">perpendicular bisector</em>
      of the line segment $AB$. Describing a
    locus in words makes it relatively easy to draw the locus, but
    it is also useful to describe the locus with an equation or
    equations, when this is possible. An equation allows you to
    find specific locus points quite quickly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Returning to problem 3, in which $P$ is always equidistant
      from the two points $A\left( {3, - 5} \right)$ and
      $B\left( { - 1, - 3} \right)$, let the
      coordinates of $P$ be $\left( {x,y} \right)$.</p>
 

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/07-3-loci/diagram%208.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">The condition for $P$ could be written
    “The distance from $P$ to $A$ is the same as the distance from $P$ to
    $B$.” Using the coordinates and diagram above, translate this
    sentence into symbols.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">In part a, you should have written
      an equation. Simplify this equation as much as possible.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Check your answer in part b for
      plausibility in a couple of ways.</p>


    <ol class="subparts">
        <li><p>
    First check to see that the point $(1, - 4)$ satisfies your
      equation in part b. Why must this be the case?</p></li>

    <li><p>
    Second, choose any other point whose coordinates satisfy your
    equation and do a calculation to see if the distance from that
      point to $A$ and $B$ is the same.</p></li>
      
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Returning again to problem 3, let’s check to see if
      your
      description of the locus was indeed correct.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find the slope and midpoint of
      $\overline {AB} $.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use your answers for part a to find
      the equation of the
      perpendicular bisector of $\overline {AB} $.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Looking again at problem 6, with the help of distance
      formula
      or Pythagoras’ Theorem, write an equation to describe the
      path of the point $P$.</p>
    </div>

    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation/inequality for the locus in each of the
      following.&nbsp;Also, in each case check that your answer is
      plausible by seeing if a couple of easily tested points
      indeed satisfy your equation.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Problem 2 ($P$’s $x$-coordinate is

      $x$-axis is always twice its distance from the $y$-axis.)</p>

      large positive number.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe the locus of the point whose equation is:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${(x + 4)^2} + {(y + 13)^2} =

    </div>

    <div class="problem">

      <p class="problem-part">$x = \left| y \right|$</p>

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>One could argue that in some cases a description of a

      do you think? Give a couple of examples to support your
      position.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In each case describe the graph and, if possible, write an

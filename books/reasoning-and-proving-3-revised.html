      <p>At Arnaldo’s small party, people shook hands with as many
      people they liked, from 0 up to everyone else at the party.
      Nayla has been paying close attention, and says that if you
      add up everyone’s personal “handshake total”, you will get
      15. Can she be correct? Explain.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p>Often in life, when someone says something that seems
    surprising, counter-intuitive, or even reasonable, we will look
    not at the conviction with which the speaker is speaking, but
    instead for the evidence and reasoning needed to back up their
    claim. In mathematics, we do the same thing. It is a fun fact
    of mathematics that many things that initially appear to be
    false are in fact true, and as well many things that appear to
    be true are false. So the only way to know if a statement is
    correct is to use clear reasoning based on assumptions we all
    agree upon.</p>

    <p>Proving is a way of demonstrating to yourself and others
    that something you think may be true (or false), must in fact
    be true (or false). Although there are many different ways of
    proving a statement, everyone agrees that the steps of a proof
    should be clear: a careful reader should be able to read each
    step of your proof and see how it connects and follows from the
    one before. That way, at the conclusion of your proof, they
    will agree with you!</p>

    <p>In the “Arnaldo’s party” problem above, at first it may seem
    a bit mystifying how to approach testing Nayla’s claim.
    Probably the best thing to do at first is to Tinker by trying
    to see if you can get a “handshake total” for all party members
    to be equal or close to 15. If you can get to exactly 15,
    you’re done; Nayla is correct, and the problem is over. On the
    other hand, if you have tried a number of different handshake
    “scenarios” and only gotten close to 15 in each case,
    nevertheless you will probably have noticed something
    interesting about handshake totals in general—something you
    might try to prove (and which will tell us if Nayla can be
    correct as well).</p>

    <p>So, when presented with a claim, do three things. First,
    decide whether it seems reasonable – do you believe it at first
    glance? Next, try to find evidence that the claim is or is not
    true. Finally, for any claim that you believe to be true, try
    to prove that it’s true by making a sequence of logical
    statements, each of which your peers could understand and agree
    to; and for any claim you believe to be false, provide an
    example that shows the claim is false—such an example is called
    a counterexample.</p>

    <p>Here’s a problem that many students have enjoyed:</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
      <figure class="fig-50">  
       <img src="../images/09-0-prove/Prove checkerboard.png">
      </figure>
      <p>A 64-square black and white checkerboard (see above) can
      clearly be completely covered by 32 dominos. If the top right
      and bottom left squares are removed, what is left is a
      62-square board. How many dominoes will be required to cover
        the 62-square board?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
      <p>[Continuation of problem 2] Did you check your answer to
      problem 2? A 64 square checkerboard is covered by 32 dominoes
      since every domino covers 2 squares, a white one and a black
      one. In the altered checkerboard, how many black squares are
      there? How many white squares? Would 31 dominoes do the
      job?</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s another problem that might seem very tricky at first,
    but with a little persistence and some tinkering . . .</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
      <p>In a stock market game, Traci claims that she can purchase
      any stock above $\$26$ by using only $\$5$ and $\$6$ coupons. (For
      example, there is no way she could purchase $\$13$ of stock with
      these coupons, but she could purchase $\$41$ of stock by using
      one $\$6$ coupon and seven $\$5$ coupons.) Do you think that Traci
      can really pull this off?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p>As a token of our affection to you, the answer is given on
    the reverse.</p>

    <p class="new-page">While it may seem plausible that there is always some
    combination of $\$5$ and $\$6$ coupons that is equivalent to a
    specific amount of money, it at first seems unlikely that we
    may be able to prove that any amount over $\$26$ can be produced
    by some combination of the two coupons. How would we know for
    sure that $\$329876$ could be paid out?</p>

    <p>Our best strategy is to begin by tinkering, and then see if
    there are any interesting patterns that emerge. We can then try
    to establish through careful reasoning that the patterns we see
    are no fluke, that they have to continue.</p>

    <p>So let’s start.</p>

    <p>The first few dollar amounts one can figure out just by
    tinkering:</p>

    <p>$\$27$ stock can be paid by using three $\$5$ coupons and two $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$28$ stock can be paid by using two $\$5$ coupons and three $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$29$ stock can be paid by using one $\$5$ coupon and four $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$30$ stock can be paid by using no $\$5$ coupons and five $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$31$ stock can be paid by using five $\$5$ coupons and one $\$6$
    coupon.</p>

    <p>Wait a second. Isn’t this sort of tedious? Doesn’t it seem
    like this approach would take us forever, and even then we
    would still have an infinity of numbers left to check? And
    weren’t we supposed to look for a pattern? There doesn’t seem
    to be any pattern in the $\$5$’s and $\$6$’s at all.</p>

    <p>Well, let’s think about a $\$32$ stock. Traci knows how to
    purchase a $\$27$ stock—three $\$5$ coupons and two $\$6$ coupons. What
    coupon should she now add in order to purchase a $\$32$ stock?</p>

    <p>Now convince yourself that Traci’s claim is valid.</p>

  <section class="development">


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>An explorer is lost in the 30 by 60 mile rectangular section
    of snowy wilderness shown below. The search and rescue team
    knows that she started her journey at the southwest corner, and
    since there hasn’t been any new snow for a while, they also
    know that they’ll be able to see her tracks.</p>
    
 <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/09-1-algorithms/Wilderness.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Obviously, the team wants to find the lost explorer as
    quickly as possible. There are different ideas about how to do
    this, though, so they decide to split into
    two groups. Group A will start at the southwest corner and
    simply follow the explorer’s trail. Group B, though, has a
    different strategy. Here’s what they do:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Group B starts out at $\left( {0,30} \right)$, and
      walks directly east. Every
      time they cross the explorer’s trail, they make a note of it.
      Suppose that by the time they reach the eastern border,
      they’ve crossed the explorer’s trail 5 times. What can they
      conclude about where the explorer must be now? How about if
      they’d crossed the trail 8 times?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>As you can see, Group B’s west-to-east walk allows them to
      cut the remaining search area in half. Their idea is to keep
      repeating this until they’ve narrowed down the search area to
      a small horizontal strip. Suppose that on the first walk
      (along $y = 30$), they crossed the trail 3 times.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What horizontal line should they
      walk next?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, suppose that on the second
      walk, they cross the
      explorer’s trail 6 times. Where could the explorer possibly
      be? Demonstrate your answer by drawing a picture of one such
      trail the explorer could have taken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem allow-break">

      <p>Is Group B’s strategy better than Group A’s? To help you
      answer this question, determine approximately how long each
      one would take to find the lost explorer in each of
      the following scenarios. (Assume that each group moves at the
      same speed, and that as soon as a group comes within
      a mile or so, they’ll see the explorer’s signal flares.)</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>The two strategies in the situation above are both examples
      of <em class="vocab">algorithms</em>— though, of course, Group A’s is a rather
    simple one. An <em class="vocab">algorithm</em> is simply a clearly defined,
    step-by-step process for accomplishing a desired task. You can
    think of every algorithm as having three main parts: input,
    process and output. In the search and rescue situation, for
    example, the input would be the whole search area and the
    explorer’s trail, and the output would be the explorer’s
    location.</p>

    <p>As you can hopefully see, thinking about and analyzing
    algorithms can be
    useful in situations where there are multiple possible
    approaches, and we want the “best” or most efficient one. But
    this kind of thinking isn’t only useful in practical
    applications — it’s also a source of some classic games and
    puzzles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The Number Devil is thinking of an integer between 1 and
      63 (inclusive), and your job is to guess it. If you guess
      wrong, the Number Devil will tell you (truthfully) whether
      your guess is too low or too high. Come up with a strategy
      for finding the Number Devil’s number in as few guesses as
      possible.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Was there anything in common between your strategy in the
    previous problem and Group B’s approach to finding the missing
    explorer? Group B’s strategy — and, likely, yours — is an
    example of a <em class="vocab">binary search</em> algorithm. (The Latin root $bini$ means “two-by-two”.) Here’s another application of it.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your English teacher has an alphabetized stack of 15
      papers,
      but she’s forgotten whose papers she collected. Now, she
      needs to check and see if she has Gabi’s paper in the stack.
      She decides to use a binary search algorithm.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Simulate this with your group: have
      a group member make an alphabetized list of names without
      showing you. The list maker gets to decide whether or not
      “Gabi” is in the list. You, in the role of the teacher, can
      ask for any individual name in the list (e.g., “Who is the
      fifth person in the list?”). How many times do you have to
      ask before you can be sure whether or not Gabi’s name is in
      the stack?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make up an alphabetized list of 15
      names that would
      force the teacher’s binary search process to make the most
      guesses possible. This is called a “worst case” input for
      the
      algorithm. How many guesses does the algorithm take,
      in the worst case?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, you decide to play a little trick on the teacher.
      Carefully rearrange the ordering of names you made in part
      b of the previous problem so that, when your teacher uses
      binary search, she’ll end up mistakenly concluding that
      Gabi’s paper is not in the stack.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Based on what happened in problem 6, it’s clear that there
    are certain situations in which the binary search algorithm
    isn’t appropriate. This is always true: every algorithm makes
    some assumptions about its input.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What assumption(s) did the teacher make in using her
      binary search algorithm?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">In addition to thinking carefully about the input, it’s also
    helpful when working with algorithms to identify the <em class="vocab">basic operations</em> your algorithm can use. The basic operations are
    always based on the situation you’re dealing with: they are
    the
    actions you’re able to do as a single “step” of your algorithm.
    In the Number Devil game, for example, your basic operation was
    to guess a number and find out if it was correct, too big, or
    too small. In the stack of papers example,
    the basic operation was to check the name on a single paper in
    the stack and compare it alphabetically with the name ‘Gabi’.
    The basic operation in the
    following game is similar to these two, but slightly
    different.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Play the following game with a classmate:</p>
    

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Your partner should write
    five different numbers on slips of paper. Then shuffle the
    papers and put them face down on the table in a straight
    row.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">You are the guesser. Your
    job is to figure out which paper has the largest number written
    on it. But you can never
    see the numbers themselves — you can only ask for
    comparisons. For example, you could point to the first
    slip and the fourth slip, and your classmate would have
    to tell you which one has the larger number.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Each comparison counts as
    one step, and your goal is to find the paper with the largest
    number with as few steps as possible.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Play the game and identify the paper
    with the largest
    number. How many steps did it take before you were
    certain about your answer?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Describe, in detail, an algorithm for
    finding the largest
    number in a list of numbers, using as few comparisons
    as possible.</p>
      
      </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Aaron has an algorithm that he claims can find the largest
      number every time using only three comparisons. Either figure
      out Aaron’s algorithm, or explain why it’s impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Here’s a somewhat different algorithmic puzzle that many
    consider a “modern classic.” (In fact, the story goes that,
    before it got out onto the Internet, this was a question that
    Google interviewers asked of potential employees.)</p>

    <p>You have two perfectly identical eggs. You need to figure
    out how high an egg can fall from a 100-story building before
    it breaks. You know nothing about the toughness of the eggs;
    they may be very fragile and break when dropped from the first
    floor. On the other hand, they may be super tough genetically
    altered eggs, so tough that that dropping them from the 100th
    floor doesn’t even cause a scratch. The only thing you know for
    sure is that they both have exactly the same “toughness.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Joey takes his first egg, and drops it off of the fourth
      floor. It doesn’t break. Then, he goes up and drops it off
      the tenth floor, and it shatters spectacularly on the
      sidewalk. Finally, he takes his second (and last) egg, and
      drops it off the seventh floor. It breaks. What can Joey
      conclude about the toughness of his eggs?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a strategy for figuring out your eggs’
      toughness. Your job is to guarantee the smallest
      number of egg-drops, in the worst case. You are
      allowed to break both eggs, but remember, two is all
      you get!</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You have 16 identical-looking coins. Fifteen of them have
      exactly the same weight, and one is too heavy. Describe
      an algorithm for finding the heavy coin in as few steps as
      possible. The basic operation allowed is to use a simple
      balance to compare 2 piles of coins to see which pile is
      heavier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the algorithm you use for adding two very large numbers
      by hand, what are the basic operations? How about multiplying
      two numbers by hand? Dividing?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe the mental algorithm a street vendor might
      use
      to quickly make change for a $\$20$ bill. Make sure your

      $\$1.50$, $\$3.00$, $\$11.45$, $\$17.26$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">

      years old.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Recall the Number Devil game from problem 4. Now let’s say
      you’re trying to guess a number between 1 and 255. If you
      were going to play using the binary search algorithm, what
      would be one worst-case number that the Number Devil could
      choose?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the following strategy to the egg-drop
      problem:</p>
  
    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow"><em>Starting at floor 1,
    drop the first egg off of odd-numbered floors until it breaks.
    Then, go back down one floor and drop the second egg. If it
    breaks, that’s the answer. If not, then the floor above is the
      answer.</em></p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Say you get to decide how
    tough the eggs are, and you want to force the strategy above to
    make the largest possible number of drops before it
    succeeds.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What is the worst-case
    input for this strategy?
    i.e., how tough should you make the eggs?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> What’s the worst-case
    number of drops?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <p>The algorithms we’ve worked with so far dealt with lists of
    information, whether they were lists of numbers, names, phone
    numbers, etc. Now, we’re going to look at algorithms that
    transform a single item, such as a number, word, etc.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You and your friend are planning to share lockers, so as
      soon as you get your combinations, you plan to exchange them
      over the phone. Each combination has three numbers in it –
      for example, 11 – 2 – 41.</p>

      <p>In case someone might be listening, though, you agree ahead
      of time to use the following algorithm to encrypt each number
      in the combination:</p>

      <p>      ${\mathop{\rm EncryptNumber}\nolimits} \left( N \right)$:</p>
      <p>If $N$ is odd, then output $2 + N$.<br>
      Otherwise, output $2 \cdot N$.</p>
 

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Notice that the notation
    being used here is similar to the “function notation” that
    you’ve seen in some previous
    lessons. “EncryptNumber” is the name of the algorithm, and $N$ is
    a name for the input to the algorithm.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your combination is 12 – 7 – 11. What
    should you tell
    your friend?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your friend tells you 80 – 28 – 29.
    What was her
    combination?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your brother wants to use the same system with his friend,
      but he’s confused about how it’s possible to “decrypt” the
      numbers he receives. Give him detailed instructions for a
      “DecryptNumber” algorithm that he can use to understand what
      his friend tells him.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One convenient feature of using function notation is that we
    can use it to easily write down things about what an algorithm
    does for specific inputs. For example, we can write
    ${\rm{EncryptNumber}}\left( 4 \right) = 8$, or
    ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( 8 \right) = 4$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {13} \right)$? How
      about ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {24} \right)$? And
      ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {18} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Predict what would happen if you applied the EncryptNumber
      algorithm to each of your three answers in the previous
      problem. Then try it out to test your prediction.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you use an algorithm to encode a message so that no
    strangers can understand it, it’s called an “encryption”
    algorithm. This is essentially what a computer does when you
    enter a password or other personal information on a website, so
    that nobody besides the website owner can see it.</p>

    <p>Another kind of encoding is called “compression”. With
    compression, the idea is to shrink the size of a message down
    so it’s faster to transport. This is why mp3’s are such a big
    deal: they allow you to compress very large song files so that
    they’re small enough to download quickly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Emmett wants to compress all the old emails he’s saved on
      his computer. Thinking of the shorthand he sometimes uses for
      text messages, he decides to go through each message and
      remove all the vowels and all the spaces. One problem with
      this approach is that it simply doesn’t shrink the message by
      all that much. However, there’s a much deeper problem. What
      is it? Can you suggest an alternative method for compressing
      Emmett’s emails?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What are some characteristics that would make a good
      compression algorithm? What characteristics are absolutely
      necessary?</p>
    </div>

    <p>You saw with the compression and encryption algorithms above
      that they’re only useful if they also have <em>de</em>compression and
      <em>de</em>cryption algorithms to go with them. These are two examples
      of a more general type of algorithm called an <em class="vocab">inverse</em>
      algorithm. When you have two algorithms, and each one reverses
      the other, then the two algorithms are called <em class="vocab">inverses</em> of each

      <p class="problem-part">If you used your sort algorithm
      from problem 39 to sort a list with $N$ items in it, how many
      comparisons would it take? See if you can express your answer
      as a simple algebraic formula.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Five pirates come across 100 bars of gold. The pirates
      have a pecking order, with #5 and #1 indicating the top and
      bottom-ranked pirates, respectively. Each pirate wants to
      maximize his or her share of the gold bars. There are no
      coalitions or
      collusions between them. They are all very analytical — they
        can think things through!</p>


      <p>Their process for splitting the loot is somewhat democratic.
      It begins with the top-ranked pirate making a proposal on how
      to divvy up the loot. (Note that the gold bars cannot be
      broken up, glued
      together, or otherwise changed; there are 100 bars of gold,
      period.) Each pirate
      gets one vote, up or down on the entire proposal. Remember,
      each pirate votes based on his or her own pocket and there
      are no side agreements of any sort. If the proposal gets 50%
      or more votes, it wins, and that’s that. On the other hand,
      if it fails to muster 50%, then the pirate who made the
      proposal is thrown overboard, and the process continues with
      the next pirate down the hierarchy.</p>

      <p>What is the maximum number of bars that the most powerful
      pirate can get and what allocation to each pirate will ensure
      him the 50% vote that he needs?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Create an algorithm to find the median of a list of

      <p>Sherlock and Watson create the following code to encrypt
      their messages:</p>

<p>      First, turn each letter into a number (A is 1, B is 2, etc).
      Then for each number, multiply it by 7 and add 1. Finally, if
      any numbers have 3 digits, just ignore the hundreds digit —

      <p>This is a famous problem that’s challenged many

Logarithms

<article>

  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The following tree diagrams, which are called <em class="vocab"> binary trees</em>,
    are all based on the same system for organizing
    information.</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Logarithms intro binary trees.png">
    </figure>
    
    <p>Each item (phone number, animal, letter) in the tree is
    called a “node”, and the nodes immediately below a node are
    called its “children”. As you can see, each node in the tree
    has at most two children. Furthermore, notice that as you start
    at the top and travel down the branches, every descendant down
    the right branch of a given node is somehow more than (or
    larger than, or after) that node, whereas every descendent to
    the left is somehow less.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s say we wanted to add the number “866-3162” to the
      phone number tree above. Even though it comes after
      “393-1765”, it would be wrong to hang it to the right of that
      number, because that would still be down the left branch from
      “555-1791”. Where should “866-3162” go? How about “squirrel”
      and “k” in their respective trees? There is only one correct
      answer for each of these.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Ask a group member to write down, without showing you, a
      list of 10 different numbers. Your group member will be
      reading the list to you one number at a time, and your job is
      to organize them into a binary search tree <em>as they’re being
        read to you</em>. There’s one rule: unlike in nature, these trees
      grow down. This means, for example, that the first number
      your group member reads will have to be the one at the very
      top of your tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Have your group member read the
      numbers to you, giving you time to add each number to the
      tree, without rearranging the ones you’ve added so far,
      before reading the next one out.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What would have happened if the
      numbers had been read to you in a different order? Try it and
      see.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In these small examples, it’s quite easy to see all the
    information at once, so they’re not necessarily any better than
    just writing out a simple list. Imagine, though, that instead
    of the 7 phone numbers in the first diagram, you had a binary
    tree with hundreds of phone numbers in it. (By the way, this is
    essentially how a cell phone really does store phone
    numbers.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Alice the ant starts at the top node of this large phone
      number tree and wants to know if the exterminator’s number,
      which she knows by heart, is in it. (She’s hoping it’s not!)
      Because Alice is so small, she can only read one node at a
      time, and she has to crawl down a branch to read another
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Describe a simple algorithm she can
      use to find out where the exterminator’s number would have to
      be, if it were in the tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Which of the following trees do you
      think Alice would rather search? Remember the old saying:
      when you’re trying to find something, it’s always in the last
      place you look!</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Trees.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>You saw from problem 2 that there is more than one possible
    “shape” that a binary tree can take, even with the same raw
    data.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each of the following, come up with a sequence of
      items, which, if you used your approach from problem 2, would
      end up in a binary tree with the given shape. (The items can
      be anything you want: names, numbers, etc.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> 
        <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image5.tif.jpg" >
        </figure>
      </p>
      
      <p class="problem-part">
          <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image6.tif.jpg" >
           </figure>
      </p>
      
      <p class="problem-part"> 
          <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image7.tif.jpg" >
           </figure>
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>The <em class="vocab">depth of a node</em> in a tree is the number of branches it
    is away from the top. So, for example, “chicken” in the animal
      tree has a depth of 2. The <em class="vocab">depth of the whole tree</em> is just the
    depth of its deepest node. (So the animal tree has a depth of
    3, because “mouse”, the deepest node, has a depth of 3.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Rearrange the lists of items you used in problem 4 so that
      the resulting trees have the minimum possible depth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Do the same for the list your group used in problem 2.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">The trees you made in problem 5 are examples of <em class="vocab">balanced</em>
    binary trees, whereas the one you made in problem 6 is not
    balanced. To see why, think of the tree like a hanging mobile:
    if each node is perfectly balanced, then the whole thing is
    balanced.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is it possible to arrange the numbers 1 through 7 into a
      balanced binary tree? How about 1 through 12? 1 through
      15?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A <em class="vocab">leaf</em> of a tree is a node that doesn’t have any children.
      Notice that in a balanced binary tree, all the leaves have
      the same depth. If a balanced binary tree has 512 leaves,
      then what is the depth of the tree?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Of course, not all trees have to be binary. If you
      continued
      the regular pattern of the tree below, how many leaves would
      the next level of the tree have? How deep would it need to be
      in order to have 4096 leaves?</p>

        <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image8.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>On some ancient computers, passwords had to consist of
      only the letters A through E. If I tell you that on these
      computers, there were 15625 passwords, and all of the
      passwords had to be the same length, can you say how many
      letters were required in a password?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the last three problems, you were effectively looking for
    exponents. You might have found yourself asking, in rather
    awkward English, the question:</p>

    <p>\[ \text{5 to the } what \ power \text{ equals 15625?} \]</p>
   
    <p>Fortunately, there’s a mathematical term for the number
      we’re looking for here: it’s called “the <em class="vocab">logarithm</em>, base 5, of
    15625”. Symbolically, it’s written <nobr>“${\log _5}\left( {15625}
      \right)$”.</nobr></p>

    <p class="new-page">So our awkward question is now both easier to pronounce:</p>

    <p>$$\rm{What \; is \; the \; log, base \; 5, of \; 15625?}$$</p>

    <p>and easier to write:</p>

    <p>$$\log_5 (15625)=x.$$</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Translate the equation above into an equation involving
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go back and set up problems 8-10 with equations using log
      notation. (No need to solve them again—just set them up.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use symbols to create a formal definition for what it
        means to say that <nobr>“$y$ is the log, base $b$, of $x$”.</nobr> Your
      definition should have the form:
        “(<em>equation involving</em> log) if and only if (<em>equation
      involving
        exponents</em>)”.</p>

<p>      This is something you can refer to whenever you need to
      translate to and from “log” notation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the following binary tree.</p>
   

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Logarithms leter tree.png" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">Assuming this tree was built
    similarly to the one you built in problem 2, what order could
    the letters have been added in?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What ordering would you use to
    produce a tree with the greatest possible depth?</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the depth of each of the trees described
      below.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A balanced binary tree that has
      1,048,576 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Every node that isn’t a leaf has 4
      children. There are 64 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Every non-leaf node has 6 children,
      and there are $X$ leaves. (Answer in terms of $X$, using log
      notation.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Unlike on this planet, primordial amoebas from Mars
      reproduce by splitting into three children. If life on Mars
      started with a single amoeba, but now there are 1,594,323
      amoebas, then:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate, without using a
      calculator, for how many
      amoeba-generations there has been life on Mars.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now rewrite the question as a
      logarithm, and find
      an exact answer (calculator allowed this time).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Translate the following awkward bits of English into log
      notation. (Notice that some are complete sentences, and
      others are fragments.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“What number could I raise 4 to, to
      get 64?”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The power of 3 that gives you
      81”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“4 to the <em>something-or-other</em> power
      equals 1024.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The number to which 6 must be
      raised in order to produce 216”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The number of times, starting with
        1, that you have to double to <nobr>get $x$”</nobr></p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Calculate the value of each of the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _3}\left( {81} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{13}}\left( {169}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _8}\left( {512} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{11}}\left( {14,641}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{100}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{1,000}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{10}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{15}}\left( {11,390,625}
      \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Start with $x = 243$. Check with your calculator that
      ${\log _3}\left( x \right) = 5$. How much do you have to add
      to $x$ to make ${\log _3}\left( x \right)$ go up by one? Up by
      two? Three?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since the number 3 is not one of the powers of 9, it’s not
    clear just what this question means, or how to find out what
    the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$ would be.
    Remember, though, that it’s also possible to have non-integer
    exponents. Let’s see if we can use that to find an answer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Start by rewriting ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right) = x$ in
      exponential form. Then, try tinkering with different ways to
      write this equation by applying some of your rules of
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You might have noticed in the problem above that it was much
    simpler to solve once you’d rewritten “3” as
    “${9^{{\raise0.5ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 1$}
    \kern-0.1em/\kern-0.15em \lower0.25ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle
    2$}}}}$”. In the next problem, try using a similar strategy:
    tinker with different ways of rewriting things, using the
    definition of logarithms and your exponent rules. (You might
    want to take a minute with your group to remind yourselves of
    all the rules.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the value of each of the following without using a
      calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _4}\left( {32} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _5}\left( {\frac{1}{{25}}}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{10}}\left( {0.000000001}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _7}\left( 1 \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why can you be sure that ${\log _2}\left( {42} \right)$ is
      not an integer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find every number from 1 to 1 million whose base-10
      logarithm is an integer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The “log” button on your calculator actually stands for
      “${\log _{10}}$”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Before trying it out, can you
      estimate roughly what ${\log _{10}}\left( {4000} \right)$ will be? Check it on the calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What are ${\log _{10}}\left( {40}
      \right)$, ${\log _{10}}\left( {40,000} \right)$, and ${\log
      _{10}}\left( 4 \right)$? What’s the pattern?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick several three-digit numbers, and use your calculator
      to find the base-10 log of each one. Now do the same with
      several four-, five-, and six-digit numbers. What do you
      notice?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _{10}}\left( 2 \right) = 0.301$, then what is
      the value of ${\log _{10}}\left( {2 \cdot {{10}^a}} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you want to see why your answer to the previous problem
    is true, try using
    the definition of log and your exponent rules to tinker with
    different ways of rewriting things, like you did earlier in
    problems 20-22. This will also help with the next two
    problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _2}\left( x \right) = 1.125$ and ${\log
      _2}\left( y \right) = 2.875$, then what is the value of
      ${\log _2}\left( {x \cdot y} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _4}\left( x \right) = 1.20$ and ${\log _4}\left(
      y \right) = 2.009$, then what is the value of ${\log
      _4}\left( {x \cdot y} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Put the following in order from least to greatest:<br>
      ${\log _2}(47)$, 2, ${\log _3}(47)$, 3, ${\log

    <h2>Introduction: Hey batta! Hey batta!</h2>

    <p>Jan bats .500 in softball — i.e., on average, for each 10
    at-bats she gets five hits. We wish to determine the
    probability that she will get no hits if she comes to bat 5
    times during a game. In order to calculate this probability we
    must assume that she stays a “.500 hitter” from one at-bat to
    the next, which is to say that success or failure at each
    at-bat is not affected by the previous at-bats. Given this
      assumption we can perform the following calculation: </p>

      <p>Probability of no hits in 5 at-bats = $ \frac{\text {number of ways of getting no hits in 5 at-bats}}{\text {number of possible outcomes in 5 at-bats}}$<br>
      = $\frac{1}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2}$<br>
      = $0.03125$  
    </p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the probability that Jan will get exactly one hit
      in 5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 4 hits in
      5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 2
      hits?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last question probably took some time to calculate since
    there are 10 different ways for Jan to get exactly 2 hits. For
    example, one string of at-bats might look like HNHNN, where H =
    “hit” and N = “no hit”. Imagine trying to calculate the
    probability that Jan would get exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats.
    Don’t do this by listing all the strings of 10 at-bats with 3
    hits. You will be cursing by the end of this process, if not
    earlier. Fortunately, there is a more elegant way of counting
    how many strings have exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats. Let’s look
    at one approach.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>This approach will require us, first, to review two basic
    counting principles that you learned last year. Suppose you’re
    setting up a password for a new account.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      then how many possible passwords are there? The password is
      not case-sensitive so there’s no distinction between “a” and
      “A”.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      but no letter or digit can be repeated, then how many
      passwords are there? Again, the passwords are not
      case-sensitive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 10 digits, no letters, with no
      repetition, then how many passwords are there? There’s a nice
      shorthand way of writing this answer. Do you remember it?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The problems above involve a basic principle of counting
      called the <em class="vocab">Multiplication Principle of Counting</em>. You also
    needed to pay attention to whether repetition mattered. Lastly,
    Problem 6 alludes to some shorthand notation that comes in
    handy when the final count gets very large. Keep in mind that
    this is only notation and doesn’t solve problems for you. As
    you progress through this lesson, you’ll need to remember that
    the formulas you might derive are not all-purpose ones that
    solve counting problems. They tend to work in highly
    specialized situations. You will find more success if you read
    each problem carefully, think about what is being counted
    (visualize, even), and then apply basic principles like the
    Multiplication Principle of Counting. Now, let’s see how to
    tackle the batting problem by looking at a similar problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The word <em>error</em> has 5 letters in it, two letters that
      appear once and one that appears three times. We’re going to
      look at different 5-letter “words” that can be formed by
      rearranging these 5 letters. These words need not make any
      sense, so “rroer” is a word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many 5-letter words can be
      formed, assuming that you can tell the difference between the
      $r$’s? In other words, think of the $r$’s as being a red $r$, a
      blue $r$, and a green $r$ (or as ${r_1}$, ${r_2}$, and ${r_3}$). By the way, each of the letters can only be used once per
      word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write down two 5-letter words that
      differ from each other only if the $r$’s are different colors.
      How many other 5-letter words differ from these two only if
      the $r$’s are different colors?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Think of another 5-letter word that
      is different from the ones in Part b. How many versions are
      there of this
      5-letter word that are distinguishable from each other
      only
      if the $r$’s are different colors? Would all of these 5-letter
      words be part of the count you made in Part a?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">So, how many 5-letter words can be
        formed by rearranging the letters in <em>error</em>, if each letter
      can only be used once per word (and the $r$’s are
      indistinguishable from each other)?</p>

      <p>Using the letters H, H, H, H, H, N, N, N, N, N, N, N only,
      how many 12-letter words can be formed? (Note: though the
      word “distinguishable” is not appearing you should
      assume you are just counting words that are different from
      each other.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the previous problems you were always counting letters.
    If you think about what you were doing, however, you should
    realize that the method of counting wasn’t dependent on
    letters. Problem 11, for example, could have initially been a
    problem about how many ways can you step right five times and
    left seven times in a sequence of twelve steps.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Bill is flipping a coin 8 times, keeping track of the
      sequence of heads and tails. What is the probability that
      he’ll get

      students to investigate whether AP classes should be taught
      in the school. If there are 16 students in the class then how
      many different committees can be formed?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last problem may have seemed quite different from the
    previous ones, but there is a way of seeing it as no different.
    Imagine that you’re working with all 16 students and that you
    have 16 Velcro labels. Twelve of these labels are a large N and
    four of them are a large Y. You line the 16 students up and
    then try to count how many different ways you can assign the
    labels to the students. In this sense, you are trying to
    determine how many different ways you can arrange 12 N’s and 4
    Y’s in a sequence.</p>

    this fraction is an answer to Problem 13. Now, use your

      combinations are there?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this lesson you have seen some problems where two
    different orderings of the same things are to be thought of as
    being different — e.g., the passwords 3857210964 and
    6710892534. In other problems, you’ve had to discount these
    differences — e.g., the triple-scoop combination of
    chocolate-vanilla-pistachio does not differ from the
    combination pistachio-chocolate-vanilla. As you work through
    the remaining problems in these lessons, bear in mind these
    distinctions. Some problems will fall into one category and not
    the other, while some will fall into both. And, of course, some
    will fall into neither.</p>

      manner: from any dot you can only move to the next dot that
      is down left or down right. So, if you are at dot A you can
      move to either dots B or C, but not directly to D or E. Below
      each dot in the triangle write the number of distinct paths
      from dot A to that dot.</p>

      <p>This curriculum was written by members (past and present) of the upper 
school math department at the Park School of Baltimore. This was possible 
thanks to Park School’s F. Parvin Sharpless Faculty and Curricular 
Advancement (FACA) program, which supports faculty every summer in major 
curricular projects. In addition to the support of FACA by the Nathan L. 
Cohen Faculty Enhancement fund and the Joseph Meyerhoff FACA fund, this 
project was also funded by grants from the E. E. Ford Foundation, the 
Benedict Foundation, Josh and Genine Fidler, and an anonymous donor.</p>

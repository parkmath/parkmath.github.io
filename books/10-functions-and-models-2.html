<article>
  <section class="development">
    
  
    <p>If you were told by a classmate that taking a cup of
    brackish lukewarm water three times a day for a month would
    heal your broken leg, you would probably laugh out loud. And
    even though your laughter might be a bit more subdued were the
    source of that statement the health segment of the evening
    news, I bet that you would nonetheless be quite skeptical. On
    many levels this would seem to you to be highly implausible,
    and so you might either absolutely dismiss it or yield to that
    nagging curiosity and check out some other sources.</p>

    <p>On the other hand there are a host of other more reasonable
    sounding claims that you might be prepared to let slide.
    Examples might include the claim that an increase in oil prices
    pushes a decline in the Dow Industrial averages, or that there
    is a strong correlation between wealth and SAT scores. It
    doesn’t seem unreasonable to hold a healthy skepticism for
    these as well.</p>

    <p>In the context of mathematics, to <em class="vocab">check for plausibility</em> is
    to routinely check the reasonableness of any statement in a
    problem or its proposed solution, regardless of whether it
    seems true or false on initial impression; to be particularly
    skeptical of results that seem contradictory or implausible,
    whether the source be peer, teacher, evening news, book,
    newspaper, internet or some other; and to look at special and
    limiting cases to see if a formula or an argument makes sense
    in some easily examined specific situations.</p>

  <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
  
      <p>Your classmate proposed traveling 240 miles to the beach
      at an average speed of 80 mph, and the next day traveling
      home at 40 mph. He pointed out that since you have an average
      speed of 60 mph, the total 480 miles there and back takes 8
      hours. Yet when you went to the beach, it didn’t take 8 hours
      round trip, even though you two drove at precisely the speeds
      he had proposed. Why?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <p class="new-page">It certainly seems at first glance that your classmate is
    correct, but just because a result seems superficially correct
    doesn’t make it so. When there is an apparent contradiction in
    a problem, it often pays to make a quick check or two to see if
    what is being said is plausible. For example, how long does
    each half of the beach trip take?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
      <p>Martin says, looking at the figure below, that the entire
      rectangle’s area divided by the area of the square inside is
      equal to $\dfrac {a} {b} + 1$. Melissa thinks that such a peculiarly
      simple answer is unlikely to be correct. Martin insists he’s
      right, and that in fact his formula would work for any values
      of $a$ and $b$ one might choose. How could Melissa check to see
      if Martin’s formula is at least plausibly correct?</p>
        
    <figure class="fig-25">

    </div>

    <p>One particular way that we check the reasonableness of a
      solution to a problem is to <em class="vocab">examine special and limiting cases</em>.
    In the problem above, what would those cases be? Well, one
    special case would surely be when $a=b$, because you could quickly determine the right answer and check if Martin’s formula is correct there. What about if we examined
    when “$a$” was small and “$b$” was large—say $a=1$ and $b=100$, or even $a=1$ and $b=10000$? Does Martin’s formula make sense in those
    cases as well? Can you come up with another limiting case, and
    see if his formula is plausible for that case as well?</p>

    <p>Once you have checked a solution for all the limiting cases
    you can think of, if it still seems like a reasonable solution,
    you might think about how to prove it always works yourself
    from first principles. Can you come up with Martin’s
    formula?</p>

      <p>If one looks at $y=x^2$ on the calculator in “ZOOM SQR” mode (so that the scale in
      the $x$ and $y$ directions are the same and the graph looks most
      accurate), it appears that the graph is getting so steep, so
      quickly, that it will eventually become a vertical line.
      
      Does it? If so, estimate for what x value it becomes
      vertical; if not, explain why that can never happen.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Hero of Alexandria came up with a formula to determine the
      area of any triangle based solely on the lengths of its 3
      sides. Below are 4 formulas, all of which purport to be
      Hero’s formula. In all 4 formulas, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the
      lengths of the sides, and $s$ is the semi-perimeter, which is
      equal to half the perimeter.</p>
    
      <p align="center">$Area = \left(s-a \right)\left(s-b\right)\left(s-c\right)$</p>
      <p align="center">$Area = \sqrt {\dfrac {(s)(a)(b)(c)} {10}}$</p>
      <p align="center">$Area = \sqrt {(s)(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}$</p>
      <p align="center">$Area = \sqrt {3(a+b+c)}$</p>

    
    <p class="problem-part">Which of these formulas do you think
    is the right one? Why?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Try seeing if the formulas give the
    kind of answers you would expect for various “common” triangles
    you have experience with.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Test to see if “extreme” triangles
    (ones with very large or small values of some of the sides)
    also give reasonable results.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What units do you typically measure
    area in? Does that also help you in deciding which formulas are
    most plausible?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Now pick the formula you are most
    confident is the right one. Does the fact that it has passed
    all your “tests” prove that it is correct? If so, explain why.
    If not, explain how you could become convinced that Hero was in
    fact correct.</p>

      says that you would always get 0, regardless of the 6 numbers
      you chose. Sassafras disagrees, and says it is highly
      dependent on choosing the right 6 numbers; for example, in
      this case, exactly 3 were above the mean and exactly 3 were

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In an earlier lesson, you learned how the trigonometric
    functions sine, cosine, and tangent were defined for angles
    other than those between 0 and 90 degrees. Here is a quick
    refresher.</p>

    <p>Imagine sitting at the edge of a merry-go-round with radius
    1 meter. You’ve set up a coordinate system with (0,0) at the
    center of the merry-go-round, and the point (1,0) is due east
    from (0,0). When the wheel starts to turn counterclockwise,
    your position is (1,0).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $42^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
      <figure class="fig-50">
        <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/merry-go-round 42 degrees.png">
      </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the merry-go-round has rotated $200^\circ$ from its
      starting
      position, find the coordinates of your position.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">This may be enough to remind you of the generalized
    definitions of sine and cosine. In the figure below, a “spoke”
    of a circle of radius 1 is drawn so that it makes a central
    angle of $\theta $ with the positive $x$-axis. The spoke
      intercepts the circle at the point $(x,y)$. The <em class="vocab">sine</em> of an
      angle $\theta $ is the $y$-coordinate of this point. The <em class="vocab">cosine</em>
    of $\theta $ is the $x$-coordinate of this point.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%202.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the figure above, how would you define the tangent
      of $\theta $?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In middle school, you learned that $\sin \theta $ is
      defined as $\frac{\text{length of the side opposite } \theta \text{ in a right triangle}}{\text{length of the hypotenuse}}$. Where is the right triangle in the figure above,
      and what are the opposite and hypotenuse?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How would you determine the sine, cosine, and tangent of
      an angle using a circle with a different radius than 1?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The circle with radius one is better known in mathematical
    circles as the “unit circle.” You’ll want to draw it — or a
    circle with a well-chosen radius — almost every time you solve
    a trig problem.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Cecilia is on a Ferris wheel and notices that, when she
      has rotated about 143 degrees from due east, she is 24 meters
      west and 18
      meters above the center of the wheel. Use this information
      to
      approximate the sine, cosine, and tangent of 143 degrees.
      Then
      see how you did by asking your calculator for these
      values.</p>

    <p>Problem 2 may have reminded you that whether the sine or
    cosine of an angle is positive or negative depends on which
      <em class="vocab">quadrant</em> the angle is in. This allows you to answer questions
    like the following.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go back to your 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 triangles and think
      about positioning them on the unit circle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a

      degrees that have a
      cosine of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Name all angles between 0 and 360
      degrees that have a
      tangent of 1.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now explain how to find <em>all</em> the
      angles that have a sine
      of $\frac{1}{2}$.</p>

      <p>Solve the equation $\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}$. How many
      solutions are there? How many solutions are interestingly
      different from one another?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Of course, you might also have to solve equations that don’t
    involve sines
    or cosines of angles in special triangles. For instance, if you
    had to solve $\sin \theta = .2531,$ you would be forced to
    resort to the inverse sine function on
    your calculator.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make sure your calculator is in degree mode, then take the
      inverse sine of .2531 to solve this equation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw the “wheel” again, and draw a spoke at the angle that
      has sine .2531. Remembering that the sine of an angle is the
      height of a point above the $x$-axis, indicate the other point
      on the wheel that would have the same sine.</p>

    <h2>Further
    Development</h2>

    <p>You’re used to measuring temperature in degrees Fahrenheit,
    but you also know that much of the world measures temperature
    using degrees Celsius. Similarly, the world uses miles and
    kilometers, ounces and grams, gallons and liters.</p>

    <p>When the Babylonians invented degree measure, they chose a
    360-degree circle for two reasons. One was that, since there
    are 365 days in a year, a degree would be very close to one
    day’s progress around the circular path they believed the sun
    made every year. Another reason is that 360 is divisible by
    lots of numbers, so
    we can describe a fourth, a sixth, an eighth, and a tenth of a
    circle as an integer number of degrees. (Try this with a 100
    degree circle and you’ll see it doesn’t work as well.)</p>

    <p>As time went on, though, mathematicians realized that the
    number 360 didn’t
    really have anything to do with circles, and in fact some of
    their calculations would be easier if they used a different
    system. This system was inspired by the close relationship
    between a central angle of a circle and the arc it intercepts.
    It was also inspired by the importance of the unit circle.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/10-1-getting-comfortable-with-trig/Lesson%201%20-%20graph%2023.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Specifically, we’d like the measure of a central angle in
    the unit circle to be literally the same as the length of the
    arc it intercepts.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the circumference of the unit circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since a 360 degree “central angle” intercepts the entire
    circle your answer to Problem 24 will be the equivalent of 360
    degrees in our new system.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How much of a circle does a 180 degree central angle
      intercept? So, in this new system, how should we represent a
      180 degree angle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Under this new system, what should we call the measure of
      an angle that intercepts a quarter-circle?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What should we call the measure of an angle that
      intercepts
      a sixth of a circle?</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you measure angles this way, you are measuring in
      <em class="vocab">radians</em>. (Try pressing the MODE button on your calculator and
    notice that there is a radian vs. degree option.) The next
    problems suggest a reason for the name.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many times does the radius of a circle “fit” around
      the circumference? (Hint: remember that the circumference of
      a circle is $C = 2\pi r$.)</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The graph of the sine and cosine functions are very
    distinctive looking.</p>

      
      
    
    <figure class="fig-50 two-up">
    <img src="../images/10-2-modeling-with-trig/Lesson%202%20-%20graph%20intro%201.tif.jpg" >

  </figure>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Which of the figures above is $y = \sin x$? Which is $y =
      \cos x$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using your knowledge of trigonometry, find coordinates for
      a few of the high and low points for each graph, and of the
        places they cross the <nobr>$x$-axis.</nobr></p>
    </div>

    <p>Though you’re used to using trigonometry to find missing
    angles and lengths in diagrams, the special shape of the graph
    of the sine and cosine functions make them very useful in
    modeling as well. Graphs that have a shape similar to that of a
      sine curve are called <em class="vocab">sinusoidal</em> (even if they involve the
    cosine instead of the sine).</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with some situations in which a graph with the
      characteristics of a sine or cosine curve would provide a
      good model.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In general, sine and cosine curves are used to model
      situations that are <em class="vocab">periodic</em>
    – that have some repeating pattern. (You might be familiar with
    this word from the periodic table, which is a chart of elements
    arranged so that, every time you begin a new row in the chart,
    the elements begin to repeat the same pattern of
    characteristics that was established in the previous row.) Sine
    and cosine functions are examples of periodic functions, and
    the distance you
    need to go on the $x$-axis before the values of the functions
      begin to repeat themselves is called the <em class="vocab">period</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the period of the sine function? How about the
      period of the cosine?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you are using radians, what is the period of each
      function?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Not all situations that are periodic will have the same
    period. Nor will all be the usual sine or cosine graphs. For
    example, one situation that lends itself well to trigonometric
    modeling is the depth of a lake at a fixed location,
    measured over time as the tide comes in and out. Here is a
    graph of some
    data for a particular lake. $D \left ( x \right )$ measures the depth of the water in
    inches
    at time $x$ hours after midnight.</p>

     <figure class="fig">
    <img src="../images/10-2-modeling-with-trig/Lesson%202%20-%20graph%205.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Though the shape of $D(x)$ is similar to that of a sine
    or cosine curve, clearly its equation is not $y = \sin x$ or
    $y = \cos x$. However, we can get the equation for this
    graph by doing various transformations of sine and cosine
    curves, much like we can take the graph of $y = {x^2}$ and
    use transformations to turn it into any parabola we choose. In
    order to figure out how to take a curve like $y = \sin x$ or
    $y = \cos x$ and turn it into the curve above, we’ll <em class="vocab">take
      things apart</em> by looking at each of the transformations
    separately.</p>

    <p></p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s first think about how we could change the period of a
    sine or cosine curve.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What type of transformation would changing the period be —
      a vertical stretch, vertical shift, horizontal stretch, or
      horizontal shift?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Suppose we wanted to cut the period of the sine function in
    half — make it $180^\circ$ instead of $360^\circ$. In other words, the sine
    function starts to repeat itself after $360^\circ$, but we want
    to find a different function that repeats itself after $180^\circ$. And put a third way (!) a partial table of values for
    the sine function looks like this …</p>

      cosine.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In addition to the change in period, the tide function
    differs from the sine
    and cosine functions in other ways. For one thing, it is
    vertically stretched as compared to those functions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Conjecture an equation for a cosine-based function that

    <p>The <em class="vocab">amplitude</em> of a sine or cosine curve is defined as <em>half</em> the vertical distance from the top to the bottom of the curve.
    This was the quantity you found in Problem 12.</p>

    <p>At this point, our graph has the right shape; we just need

    you learned how to do when studying quadratics, though if
    you’ve forgotten, try experimenting with your calculator when
    answering the next few questions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>To remind yourself how to do a horizontal shift, first try
      writing equations that shift the graph of $y = {x^2}$ three
      units to the right, then three units to the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now use the same technique to shift the graph of $y = \cos
      x$ by 90 degrees to the right, then 90 degrees to
      the left.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>It’s not obvious how to do a horizontal shift at the same
      time that you change the period of a graph. First make a
      sketch of $y = \cos 90x$. Then write an equation that you
      could use to shift this graph two units to the right. Check by
      using your calculator to graph your equation, and refine your

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You might recall from Physics class that Newton’s 2nd Law
      of Motion tells us that the net force on an object divided by
      its mass equals its acceleration, i.e., $a = \frac{F_{net}}{m}$. Let’s look at the
      case of a person pushing a bobsled and its passengers on the
      ice.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If the mass of the bobsled and
    passengers is 300 kg and the person pushes so that there is a
    net force of 900 Newtons on the bobsled, what is the
    acceleration of the bobsled (the units are in
    meters/sec$^{2}$)?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> If the net force on the
    bobsled is tripled, does the acceleration triple?</p>

 	<p class="problem-part"> If, instead, the net force
    remained at 900 N but the mass of the bobsled and passengers
    was tripled from part a, what would happen to the
    acceleration?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> What would be the effect on
    the acceleration of tripling the net force and the mass from
    part a at the same time?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What would happen to the
    acceleration if the net force were the same as part a, but the
    mass of the bobsled and passengers was cut in half?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Finally, what would be the
    effect on the acceleration if one both doubled the net force
    from part a and halved the mass at the same time?</p>

      <p>As you know, the circumference of a circle and the area of
      a circle of radius $r$ can be found through the formulas $C =
      2\pi r$ and $A = \pi {r^2}$.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If one circle has a radius of
    1 meter and another has a radius of 3 meters, how many times
    bigger is the circumference of the second circle? How many
    times bigger is its area?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If one circle has a radius of
    2.687 meters and another has a radius 3 times as big, how many
    times bigger is the circumference of the second circle? How
    many times bigger is its area?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Based on parts a and b, what
    do you think you can conclude in general? Prove your answer by
    considering two circles, one with radius $X$ and the other with
    radius $3X$, and by doing some minor algebra.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">The volume of a sphere of
    radius $r$ can be found by using the formula $V=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}$. If you have two
    spheres, where the larger sphere has a radius 5 times that of
    the smaller sphere, how many times bigger must the larger
    sphere’s volume be? Prove that your answer is correct no matter
    what the radius of the smaller sphere is.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If one sphere is
    $\frac{1}{4}$ the radius of another, what fraction of the
    larger sphere is the volume of the smaller sphere? Again, prove
    your answer works for any two spheres that have this

      <p>The braking distance of a car is the minimum distance a
      car going at speed $v$ can stop in (by using the brakes,
      of course). By using some fundamental physics, one can
      calculate the braking distance, assuming a car of average
      weight and a dry road, by the equation $d = .06{v^2}$,
      where $v$ is in miles per hour and $d$ is in feet.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If Jessup hits the brakes

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the previous problem you examined the volume and

      ($6{x^2}$). Is this true of more complicated shapes? Let’s
      see.</p>

      and were 3 inches high.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">Assuming the other dimensions
    were proportionally reduced, what is the scale factor of the

    <p>The types of relationships between variables that you have
    been exploring in the previous problems are special cases of
    two broad categories: direct proportionality and inverse
    proportionality.</p>

    <p>$y$ is <em class="vocab">directly proportional</em> to $x$ when $y = kx$, where $x$
    and $y$ are variables and $k$ is a constant not equal to 0. Another
      way of saying this is that $y$ <em class="vocab">varies directly</em> with $x$. For
    example, in problem 2, where $C = 2\pi r$, we say that $C$ is
    directly proportional to $r$, or that $C$ varies directly with
    $r$.</p>

    <p>$y$ is <em class="vocab">inversely proportional</em> to $x$ when $y = \frac{k}{x}$,
    where $x$ and $y$ are variables and $k$ is a constant not equal to 0.
      Another way of saying this is that $y$ <em class="vocab">varies inversely</em> (or
      <em class="vocab">indirectly</em>) with $x$. For example, in problem 1c, where $a =
    \frac{{900}}{m}$, we say that $a$ is inversely proportional to
    $m$, or that $a$ varies inversely with $m$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Answer the following questions by using the definitions of
      direct and inverse proportionality given above.</p>
    

    <p class="problem-part">If $WZ = 100$, are $W$ and $Z$
    directly or inversely proportional, or neither?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If $\frac{C}{T} = 64$, do $C$
    and $T$ vary directly or indirectly, or neither?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">If $P = Q + 20$, are $P$ and
    $Q$ directly or inversely proportional, or neither?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Suppose $Z$ is directly
    proportional to $S$. As $S$ increases, must $Z$ also increase?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Suppose $M$ varies inversely
    with $R$. As $R$ increases, must $M$ decrease?</p>
      
    </div>

    <p class="No-Paragraph-Style">Just as it is useful to say that
    “$A$ varies directly with $B$”, we can apply this language to a
    wider range of expressions as well. For example, in problem 4,
    where $A = 6{x^2}$, we can say that $A$ varies directly with
    ${x^2}$, as $A$ is equal to a constant times ${x^2}$.
    Alternatively, we could also have said in words that surface
    area is directly proportional to the square of the side length
    of the cube.</p>

      <p>In the following questions, either write an equation

    <p class="problem-part">The weight of a human is
    directly proportional to its volume.</p>

    varies directly with the square of its radius.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">From problem 3, $d =
    .06{v^2}$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">The intensity of light varies
    inversely with the square of the distance from the light
    source.</p>

      <p>Biologists have determined a good approximation of the

      defined as the velocity at which an object travels the most
      distance for a given amount of energy it expends; the easiest
      analogy is with cars, where the most fuel efficient speed to
        drive turns out to be 55 mph.</p>

      <p>The relationship is $M = \frac{{{V^6}}}{{729000000}}$,
      where $V$ is the optimum cruising speed measured in

      <p>“The Attack of the 50 Foot Woman!” was a campy “sci-fi”
      thriller from the 1950’s, about a woman who, due to an alien
      encounter, grows to be a 50 ft giant, wreaking havoc on the
      metropolis she lives in. Could humans prosper at such heights
      if, say, our DNA gave our body permission to “keep growing”?
      Let’s check it out.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Here are two important facts: 1)
      The weight of any animal is directly proportional to its
      volume, and 2) The strength of a bone is directly
      proportional to the cross-sectional area of the bone. Write
      equations that represent these relationships.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A 50 ft woman is 10 times taller
      than a <br>5 ft woman, indicating that one could roughly think
      of her as a 5 ft woman scaled up by a factor of 10 in all
      dimensions. How many times more would the 50 ft woman weigh
      than the <br>5 ft woman?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Since all dimensions are scaled by
      a factor of 10, how many times stronger would the 50ft.
      woman’s bones be than the 5 ft woman’s?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Bones in the leg break if they are
      under too much strain/pressure, that is, if there is too much
      weight above pressing down on the bones. Using your answers
      to parts b and c, determine how the pressure (i.e.
      $\frac{{{\rm{Weight}}}}{{{\rm{Cross - sectional \ area}}}}$
      of the leg bones) on the 50ft woman’s leg bones compares to
      the 5 ft woman’s.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Thus explain why animals that are

      <p>Physics tells us that an object falling in a vacuum will,
      because of gravity, get faster and faster — there’s no limit
      on its top speed as it falls. In practice, though, the
        Earth’s atmosphere causes <em class="vocab">drag</em>. Because of this, a falling
      object (like, say a skydiver) will initially speed up, but
        eventually will reach its <em class="vocab">terminal velocity</em> — its constant
      top speed, where the drag force perfectly cancels out
        gravity, so that there’s no more acceleration.</p><p>
      According to Wikipedia, the square of the terminal velocity
      of an object is directly proportional to its mass and
      inversely
      proportional to its cross-sectional area.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If the radius of the larger of the

      <p class="problem-part">Now suppose that two balls, this
        time made of <em>different</em> materials, turn out to have the same
      terminal velocity. If the radius of the larger ball is twice
      the radius of the smaller, then which ball is made of a
      denser material? How do their densities compare? (Note:
      density = mass/volume.)</p>

    <p>Use your calculator to plot these data, with the Facebook
    population on the $y$-axis, and time in months on the $x$-axis.
    Then, try to predict how many people were on Facebook at the
    beginning of 2010.</p>
      
</div>
    
    <p>Looking at the data, it’s quite clear that the Facebook
    population has been growing over time, and it’s also pretty
    easy to see that the $rate$ at which it’s growing is
    increasing, too. Even if we take those two observations into
    account, though, there seems to be quite a wide range of
    plausible predictions in problem 1. It’s hard to know how to
    decide whether, say, 375 million users or 500 million users is
    the better prediction.</p>

    <p>What if we could find an equation that appeared to fit the
    existing data very well? In that case, we would have reason to
    believe that the equation was a good mathematical model for
    Facebook population growth, and we could therefore make more
    specific, confident predictions.</p>

    <p>If you’ve studied biology, you might have seen that
    exponential models are one of the simplest and most common
    types of models used for population growth. Even though
    Facebook isn’t quite same as, say, bacteria in a Petri dish, it
    turns out that these data indeed appear to exhibit exponential
    growth. Let’s find an exponential function that fits the data.
    Recall that, by definition, an exponential function has an
    equation in the form $y = a \cdot {b^x}$, where $a$ and $b$ are
    constants.</p>
      
    

    <div class="problem">
      <p>To find constants for our data, we’ll need to substitute
      two points into the general exponential equation, and then
      solve the resulting pair of equations for $a$ and $b$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">We have more points than we need:
      since there are only two constants to solve for, we actually
      only need two points. Which of the following pairs of points
      do you think we should use to get the best fit for the whole
      data set? Why?
      <br>
        $\left( {12,1} \right)$ and $\left( {24,5.5} \right)$
      <br>
      $\left( {24,5.5} \right)$ and $\left( {64,200}
      \right)$
      <br>
      $\left( {36,12} \right)$ and $\left( {62,175}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For each of the pairs of points in
      part a, find the equation of an exponential function that
      goes through the two points. Then, use your calculator to
      graph each of these three equations together with the actual
      data. Which one was the best fit? Which was worst? Why?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using whichever equation from problem 2 fit the data best,
      predict the Facebook population at the beginning of 2010.
      Compare your predictions to the actual data, available at:
      http://www.facebook.com/press/info.php?timeline.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Jenn Jeffings, ecologist extraordinaire, has taken some
    data, shown below, on chestnut oak trees in the woods around
    her house. She used the house as home base, and counted the
    number of chestnut oaks within certain distances. So, for
    example, the second row in the table indicates that Jenn
    counted 63 chestnut oaks that were each no more than 10 meters
    away from the house. Plot these data using your calculator.</p>

    <p>You can see clearly that, just as with the Facebook data,
    the $y$ values are increasing<br>
    at a faster and faster rate.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Are the data exponential? Either use an equation and some
      algebra, or else work directly with the numbers to answer
      this question.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It turns out that Jenn’s tree data can be modeled accurately
      using a <em class="vocab">power function</em>, which is any function that can be described with an equation of the form $y = a \cdot {x^n}$, where $a$ and $n$
    are constants.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Strategically pick two points and use them to solve for
      the constants $a$ and $n$. Check out the particular equation
      that results by graphing it on your calculator together with
      the data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>According to the model you made in problem 5, how many
      chestnut oaks are within 100 meters of Jenn’s house?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The equation you came up with in problem 5 is just one
    example of a power function. Let’s take a brief look at these
    functions in general.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is the graph of $y = 5{x^2}$ exactly five times steeper
      than the graph of $y = {x^2}$ ? Is it exactly five times
      higher? Experiment with some values of $a$ other than 5, and
      see if you can get any different effects. In each case, it
      will be helpful to compare your graph to the more basic $y =
      {x^2}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph $y = {x^4}$ and $y = {x^5}$ on your calculator.
      Compare them to $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^3}$. Now predict
      what $y = {x^{94}}$ and $y = {x^{95}}$ will look like.
      Check your prediction. What can you say in general about
      power functions where $n$ is a positive integer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the coordinates of a specific point that <em>must</em> be on
      the graph of $y = 3{x^n}$, regardless of the value of $n$.
      Then find one more.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let’s go back to the Facebook data we looked at in the
    introduction. In problem 2, you should have seen that the
    equation $P = 0.637 \cdot {1.094^t}$ fit the data best. For
    consistency, let’s use that equation for the following
    problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose you were writing a <em>Postscript</em> article about
      Facebook’s incredible exponential growth, and you wanted to
      include a prediction about when we would expect the Facebook
      population to reach 1 billion users. According to the
      equation, when will this happen?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>According to the equation, how long will it be after your
      answer to the previous problem until the population reaches 2
        billion users? And how long after <em>that</em> until it hits 4
      billion users?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation that expresses the time $t$, as a
      function of the population $P$. In other words, rewrite the
      equation $P = 0.637 \cdot {1.094^t}$ in “$t = $ ” form.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On the one hand, you could think of this equation as being
    the same as, or equivalent to, the original “$P = $ ”
    equation. On the other hand, though, it’s quite clear that in
    this equation, the “input” and “output” variables have been
    reversed. As you might recall from the lesson on algorithms,
    this means that the equation you wrote in problem 12 represents
      the <em class="vocab">inverse</em> of the original function. (Actually, they are inverses of each other.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Equations of the form $y = a{\log _b}\left( x \right) + c$ are called <em class="vocab">logarithmic functions</em>. If you haven’t already, use a bit of algebra to show that the equation you wrote in problem 12 is, indeed, a logarithmic function. Why does it make sense that the inverse of an exponential function would be a
      logarithmic function?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Below is a graph of the equation $P = 0.637 \cdot
      {1.094^t}$ .</p>

      using your calculator, make a large (at least half-page) and

      input on the horizontal axis.) What do you notice about the graph?</p>

      <p>One night, at their vacation home in Maine, Brad Pitt and
      Angelina Jolie had a fight. Brad couldn’t sleep that night,
      and so he was up when the sun rose at 7:04am. By the time it
      set at 4:22pm, they still hadn’t made up. Using the data in
      the table, is it possible to say which day of the year
      Brangelina had their fight?</p>

      <p>Often, when we are trying to model a phenomenon using mathematics, we’re interested in using one variable, called the <em>input</em>, to predict the value of another
        variable, the <em>output</em>. This is generally only possible, however, if the input uniquely determines the output — or, in other words, when there is at
      most one output for any given input. When this is the case,
        we say that the relationship is a <em class="vocab">function</em>. This was true,
      for example, in the Facebook population example at the
      beginning of the lesson, but it was $not$ the case in problem

      <p>The data you’ve seen in the previous problem, as well as
      in problem 29, are examples of what’s called the “80-20
      rule,” or the “Pareto principle.” Vilfredo Pareto, an economist in the late
      1800’s, made two oddly related observations: 80 percent of
      Italy’s wealth was owned by roughly 20 percent of the
      population, and 80 percent of the peas he harvested in his
      garden came from roughly 20 percent of the pea plants.
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle.)
      </p>
      <p>Since then, a surprising number of phenomena
      have been discovered to follow this general rule. Here’s
        another example.</p>
      
      <div class="problem"><p>The data set below comes from a study of how
      often different words appear in a large sample of English
      text. The first column represents a certain level of rarity
      or commonness for a word, and the second column shows how
      many words had appeared with that frequency.
      So, for example, there were 586 words that appeared around
      200 times, whereas there were only 73 words that appeared 600
      times.</p>

Lesson 5:


Making New Functions 
</h1>
          
          
          

<article>

  <section class="development">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In previous lessons, you may have used exponential, logarithmic,
    and power functions to model data. For instance, if you had evidence that the data could
    be modeled by an exponential function, then your task was to
    find values for $a$ and $b$ in the function type $f(x) = a{b^x}$.
    However, one problem in the Exponential Functions lesson involved a kind of exponential
    function for which it wouldn’t work simply to find $a$ and $b$. A 180$^\circ$ cup of coffee is left out to cool in a 70$^\circ$ room.
    Below is a graph showing the temperature of the coffee over time.</p>
    
   <figure>
      <img src="../images/10-5-making-new-functions/Lesson 5 - intro graph.tif.jpg">
    </figure>
    
    <p>A function that does a decent job of modeling this data is
    $f(x) = 99.5{(.895)^x} + 71.$ You can think of the function as
    a translation
    of 71 units up of the more familiar function $g(x) =
    99.5{(.895)^x}$.</p>

    <p>It’s easy to imagine changing the vertical shift of $g$ in
    order to produce lots of different functions, perhaps
    corresponding to cooling curves in rooms of different
    temperatures. More generally, in modeling data it’s useful to
    be able to start with basic function types and use
    transformations in order to control the shape and position of
    those graphs. We will begin our study of this technique by
    examining more abstract types of functions.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Below is a graph of a function $f$. Note that $f$ is not one of
    the function types you have studied before. It does not have a
    nice formula. But its graph is still enough for you to answer
    questions about input and output.</p>
    
    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/10-5-making-new-functions/Lesson 5 - development.tif.jpg">
    </figure>
    
    <p>A table of values for the function might look like this:</p>

    <table id="table-1" class="Basic-Table">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>$x$</p>

          <td>1</td>

          <td>2</td>

          <td>3</td>

          <td>4</td>

          <td>5</td>

          <td>6</td>

          <td>7</td>

          <td>8</td>
        </tr>

        <tr>
          <td>
            <p>$f(x)$</p>
          </td>

      </tbody>
    </table>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Fill in the four missing values.

</p>
</div>

    <p>Note that we say “a table of values” “might” look like this
    because there are far more points on the graph of this
    function. If you wanted to, you could use $x = 3.5$ in the
    table, or even $x = \pi $. The dashes in the table are
    there because the function is not defined for certain inputs:
    specifically, for $x &lt; 2$ and $x &gt; 7$. Another way of
      saying this is that the <em class="vocab">domain</em> of the function is $2 \le x \le
    7$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Using the same function f as in problem 1, draw the following
      graphs. If you need help getting started, remember that an
      expression like “$f(4) + 2$ ” means “two more than the value
      of $f(4)$.”


</p>
<p class="problem-part"> $y = f(x) + 2$</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> $y = \frac{1}{2}f(x)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> $y = - f(x)$</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 2, you saw examples of a vertical translation, a
    vertical contraction, and a reflection over the $x$-axis.
    Horizontal transformations merit a little more attention.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Much as we can define the function $y = f(x) + 2$, we can
      define the function $y = f(x - 2)$.


</p>
<p class="problem-part"> Find the output of the function $y
      = f(x - 2)$ for the input $x = 5$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Make a table of values with the

      think about which values of $x$ it makes sense to use.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Using the values from your table in Problem 3, graph the
      function $y = f(x - 2)$. How was the graph of $y = f(x)$
      transformed to make this new graph?

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      What is the domain of the function you graphed in
      Problem 4?

</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Conjecture a formula (like $y = f(x - 2)$ ) that translates
      the graph of $y = f(x)$ three units to the left. Then make a
      table and/or graph to see if you are right.

</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Now consider the function $y = f(2x)$. First find the output
      when $x = 2$. Then make a table of values with the headings
      $x$ and $f(2x)$, and fill it in. Take care to think about
      which values of $x$ it makes sense to use.

</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Using the values in your table from Problem 7, graph the
      function $y = f(2x)$. Describe the transformation of the
      graph of $y = f(x)$ this represents.

</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      What is the domain of the function you graphed in
      Problem 8?

</p>
</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Conjecture a formula that horizontally stretches the graph of
      $y = f(x)$ so that each point is three times farther away
      from the y-axis.

</div>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Use a similar process to graph $y = f(-x)$ . What transformation of the

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Find a formula for $f( - x)$ if $f(x) = {x^2} + 2x - 8$.
      Then sketch the graphs of $y = f(x)$ and $y = f( - x)$ on the
      same axes.

</p>
</div>

    <p>Using transformations is one way to build a new function
    from a known function. You can also combine two functions to
    get a third.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Let $f$ be the function from the introduction (shown below, on
      the left), and $g$ be the function defined by the graph below,
      on the right.

<p class="problem-part"> The function $h$ is defined by the
      equation $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$.
      For example, to find the value of $h(3)$, you would

      together the values of $f(3)$ and $g(3)$. Find $h(3)$, then sketch a
      graph of $h$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> Now sketch a graph of $j(x) = f(x) -
      g(x)$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The following exercise illustrates another way to combine
    functions, known as <em class="vocab">composition</em> of functions. Composition is
    when you “chain” two functions together, by taking the output
    of one function and using it as the input to a second function.
    To see why this might be useful, consider the following
    situation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>

      Howie is chewing Super-Bubble gum and blows a super-bubble.
      The radius (in inches) of his bubble increases with time (in
      milliseconds) in a way given by the equation $r(t) = 2t^{0.25}$. What is the
      volume of Howie’s bubble 5
      milliseconds after he blows it?

</p>
</div>

    <p>In order to solve the previous problem, you had to do two
    things. First, you had to find the radius of the bubble at 5
    milliseconds. Then you had to use the radius you found in order
    to find the volume of the bubble. In function language, if $V$ is
    the familiar function $V(r) = \frac{4}{3}\pi {r^3}$ giving the
    volume of the bubble in terms of the radius, then you first
    found $r(5)$, and then found $V(r(5))$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
<p>


</p>
<p>Using the functions $r$ and $V$ as in the previous problem,</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> find $V(r(3))$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> find a formula, in terms of $t$, for

      The tribble population grows exponentially, and the level
      of the squeaky noise they collectively make is directly
      proportional to the size of their population. Let the tribble
  functions be defined as follows:</p>

      <p>$P$ outputs the tribble population at time $t$.</p>

      <p>$N$ outputs the noise level produced by a given number
        of tribbles.</p>

    see that the sine function does not have an inverse! There are
    many ways to get an output of 1: when $x$ is 90°, 270°, 450°, etc
    if you are working in degrees, or when x is $\frac{\pi }{2}$,
    $\frac{{3\pi }}{2}$, $\frac{{5\pi }}{2}$, etc if you are
    working in radians. Thus, if someone says, “find ${\sin ^{ -

      Trigonometric functions are not the only common functions
      that require a domain restriction in order to take their
      inverse. $f(x) = {x^2}$ does not have an inverse because for
      a given output, like 4, there are multiple inputs, -2 and 2,
      that produce that output. However, if you restrict the domain
      of $f$ to allow only values of $x$ greater than or equal to zero,
      then the function has an inverse. You can think of the square
      root function as the inverse of $f(x) = {x^2}$ on this
      restricted domain.

<p class="problem-part"> For each function below, suggest a domain restriction that
      would allow the function to have an inverse.</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> For functions i, ii, and iii, find

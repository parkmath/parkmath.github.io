        <p>In a well-shuffled 52-card deck, half the cards are red

    <p>Many difficult problems that you come across can seem fairly
    straightforward, as frequently you have a good sense of where
    to start and what steps to take, even if each step is quite
    challenging. For some problems, though, the difficulty lies in
    not knowing at all what to do. In these cases it initially
    seems impossible to figure out how to get started.</p>

    <p>To <em class="vocab">Tinker</em> means to try possibilities and adjust your
    strategy based on what you’ve learned from your efforts.
    Tinkering is like trying to fit puzzle pieces together — you
    need to test out the pieces to see if they’ll fit, but even if
    it doesn’t work you now have a better sense of the shape of
    each piece.</p>

    <p>The important thing is to <em>do something</em>, even if you aren’t
    at all sure it will be helpful. Make a start. Don’t be
    paralyzed by the problem. When you work on a math problem, as
    you tinker, you are gathering information — information that
    might lead to a solution or that might lead to a more
    interesting question.</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Trying a specific example</em>, even when the problem does not
    ask for one, is an example of <em class="vocab">tinkering</em>. In the above problem,
    for instance, try just guessing the number of red cards that
    are in the top half of the deck, and see what you can figure
    out from there. Even though your first guess is likely to be
    wrong, that’s perfectly OK. If you pay attention to the numbers
    you get for the amount of red and black cards in each half of
    the deck, you can adjust and make a much more educated guess
    the next time. That is, sometimes you will not notice a pattern
    until you generate some data for yourself.</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Tinkering</em> is a way of making abstract ideas and hard to
    approach problems concrete, so that you can really see what is
    going on.</p>

    <p>The next few pages have a couple of problems for you to
    <em class="vocab">Tinker</em> with. After you have tried a few different approaches,
    you can turn over the page and see if the solution provided was
    similar to yours, or if perhaps you came up with a better
    way!</p>

    <p>Let’s start with a bit of a mystery:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>Each letter in the addition problem below represents a
          different number.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          $\begin{align}
          AB& \\
          \underline{+\quad BC}& \\
          ADD&
          \end{align}$
        </p>
        
        <p>What are the only
          possible values of $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$?
          Try solving it before you turn over the page.</p>
            
      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">After perhaps tinkering with a number of different random
    values for $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, just to see what seems to be working
    and what isn’t, you may have noticed that there is only one
    plausible value for $A$. What is it?</p>

    <p>So now our problem has turned into:</p>

    <p>
      $\begin{align}
      1B& \\
      \underline{+\quad BC}& \\
      1DD&
      \end{align}$
    </p>

    <p>Could $B$ be 7 or lower?</p>

    <p>If you conclude that $B$ is greater than 7, then it must be 8
    or 9. So tinker a bit here. Replace $B$
    by 9 and see what happens.</p>

    <p>The problem would then be:</p>

    <p>
      $\begin{align}
      19& \\
      \underline{+\quad 9C}& \\
      1DD&
      \end{align}$
    </p>

    <p>Now what could $D$ be? How about $C$?
    (Remember we were told all the letters
    represented <em>different</em> digits.)</p>

    <p>At this point you might have seen that $B$ must be 8. Now find
    $C$ and $D$, and be sure to check that your solution works.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>Here’s a logic puzzle that might drive you a bit crazy at
          first, but you’ll find the solution quite satisfying:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Al says: Bob is lying.</li>
          <li>Bob says: Carl is lying.</li>
          <li>Carl says: Al and Bob
            are both lying.</li>
          
        </ul>
        <p>Who is lying? Who is telling the truth?
          There is only one possible answer.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>If this seems impossible to solve, try just guessing
    right from the start who is telling the truth and
    who is lying, and see if your answer is consistent with what
    all three people are saying. If your initial
    answer doesn’t work, then adjust your guess and
    try again.</p>

    <p>The answer is on the back of this page.</p>

    <p class="new-page">There is no question that this problem can tie you up in
    logical knots! Let’s try to approach it by assuming Al is
    telling the truth, and we’ll see where that gets us. If this
    assumption works, great! And if it doesn’t, hopefully we will
    have learned some valuable information about the problem.</p>

    <p>If Al is telling the truth, that means that Bob is
    lying.</p>

    <p>If Bob is lying, that means that he is lying about Carl
    lying, which means that Carl is telling the truth.</p>

    <p>Now if Carl is telling the truth, that would mean that Al
    and Bob would both have to be lying. But we assumed at the
    start that Al was telling the truth! Al can’t both be telling
    the truth and lying. Our assumption that Al was telling the
    truth causes us to contradict ourselves, so it must be wrong.
    Therefore, since Al can’t be telling the truth, <em>Al must be
    lying.</em></p>

    <p>But does the problem really work out if Al is lying? Test it
    out and see.</p>

    <p>So, who is lying, and who is telling the truth?</p>

    <p>In case you were wondering if you could have started solving
    this problem by assuming, say, that Carl was telling the truth,
    and following the consequences from there, the answer is yes,
    absolutely. There are many ways to solve this problem, just as
    with many other math problems. The key is that all these
    different methods will eventually end up with the same
    answer.</p>

        <p>The number 73 can be written as the sum of 73 consecutive
        integers.
        What is the product of these 73 integers?
        <cite>(Copyright <a href="http://www.mathleague.com">mathleague.com</a>.)</cite></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>If you were reading a book about juggling for beginners, and
    it recommended starting out by trying to juggle 7 balls, you
    would rightly think that advice was crazy. Even someone who had
    no idea how to juggle could tell you that starting out with 3
    (or even 2!) balls lets you get a better handle on what is
    going on. Before one tackles complicated problems, it makes
    sense to try easier, related ones first.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, the way we cut a problem that is
    intimidatingly large or confusingly abstract down to size is to
    <em class="vocab">Change or Simplify the Problem</em>. In the problem above, having to
    deal with 73 integers makes the problem initially seem
    extremely hard. How would one even approach finding the 73
    consecutive integers that add to 73, and how on earth if you
    found them could you find their product in a reasonable amount
    of time?</p>

    <p><em class="vocab">Trying a Smaller Number</em> is a very popular and useful way to
    change or simplify the problem. As with the juggling, it
    frequently allows you to get a much better understanding of
    what is going on. So in the problem above, why not see if you
    can simplify it by replacing all the 73’s with 5’s. Then,
    hopefully you can use the insight you have gained with the
    easier problem to solve the original problem as well. Give it a
    try!</p>

    <p class="new-page">Another variation on this theme occurs when a problem is
    stated in terms of variables like $X$ or $Z$,
    such as:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>At Bob's Breakfast Bungalow, the toast buffet involves $X$ kinds of bread and $Z$ kinds of jam. How many different bread-jam pairings are there, assuming that the customers use only one kind of jam each time they make toast?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>When stated so abstractly (“$X$ kinds of bread and $Z$ kind of jam”), the
    problem can be hard to think about. <em class="vocab">Changing Variables to
    Numbers</em> is another way to change or simplify the problem. Why
    not try specific numbers for $X$ and $Z$ to get a better sense of
    what is going on? It might make sense to try a few different
    pairs of numbers so that you can be sure that you have the right
    idea. Once you do, then, as with trying a smaller number, you
    can use what you have learned to go back and solve the
    original, more abstract (and likely more complicated)
    problem.</p>

Lesson 1:


Defining New Symbols

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You have a pocket calculator that can only do one thing —
    when you type in two whole numbers, it takes the first number,
    adds the second number to it, adds the first number to the sum,
    then takes that whole answer and multiplies it by the second
    number. The number you see on the screen is its final answer
    after this series of steps.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you type in 7 and 2, what will your calculator
      show?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What if you type in 2 then 7?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your friend uses the calculator. You can’t see the first
      number
      she types in, but the second number is 3. The answer that the
      calculator gives is 39. What was the first number?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>The calculator’s rule (from the problems above) has a symbol
    to represent it: “$\triangle$”.
    For example, “$7\triangle2$” refers to what you did in question #1.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $2\triangle10$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $5\triangle y$, in terms of $y$? Simplify as much as possible
      (no parentheses in your answer).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $x\triangle8$ ?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is $x\triangle y$, in terms of $x$ and $y$? Write this as an
      equation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you invented the symbol “$\triangle$” for a
    math problem you wrote, and wanted to explain it in an equation
    rather than in words, you would say:</p>

    <p>“Let $x\triangle y$ _______________________” (your answer to question
    7).</p>

    <p>This is called the algebraic rule for $\triangle$.</p>

    <p>Here the word “Let” is used the same way as when a problem
    says “Let $x$ be the number of boxes you purchase.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>After trying out a few different whole numbers as inputs
      to the $\triangle$ rule,
      John makes the following claim: “To get an odd number for
      your answer from $\triangle$, you need to input odd numbers for $a$ and
      $b$.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does John’s claim seem reasonable
        to you? If it doesn’t, find a <strong>counterexample</strong> — a specific
      example which proves that his statement is not always
      true.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is John’s claim true?</p>
    </div>

    <p>These two questions are quite different — in many
    situations, there can be a variety of different predictions
    that seem reasonable, but only one of them may be actually
    true! The habit of seeking proof is not only about learning how
    to prove a statement to be true — it’s also about learning to
    ask “Why would that be true?” when you are presented with a
    reasonable statement.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol “&amp;”, applied to two whole numbers, means
      that you take the first number and then add the product of
      the numbers.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $4$&amp;$7$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $7$&amp;$4$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an algebraic rule for
      &amp;.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Here is another of John’s claims.
      “To get an odd number for your answer from $a$&amp;$b$, you need to input an odd number for $a$ and an even
      number for $b$.”
      
      Is his new claim true? If you think it is true, carefully
      explain why.
      
      If you believe it’s not true, give a counterexample.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Just like any symbol regularly used in mathematics
      ($+ , - , \cdot , \div $), symbols that we create can be
      used inside
      an equation.
      
      Let $m \  \unicode{x263c} \ n = 3n - m$. Calculate the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$5 \  \unicode{x263c} \  2$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$6 \cdot (5 \  \unicode{x263c} \  2)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(1 \  \unicode{x263c} \  3.5)$$- {\rm{ }}(3.5 \  \unicode{x263c} \  1)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$2 \  \unicode{x263c} \  (3 \  \unicode{x263c} \  5)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(2 \  \unicode{x263c} \  3) \  \unicode{x263c} \   5$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(a \  \unicode{x263c} \  b) \  \unicode{x263c} \  c$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In problem 10, is $m \  \unicode{x263c} \   n = n \  \unicode{x263c} \  m$ true in general, for
      ANY input numbers $m$ and $n$? Explain.</p>
    </div>

  <section class="problems">
  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\unicode{x00a9}$ two numbers, it gives you the
      third number in the addition/subtraction pattern. For
      example, $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {21,23} \right\} = 25$ (going up
      by $2$’s), and $©\left\{ {95,90} \right\} = 85$ (going
      down by $5$’s).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x00a9} \left\{ {6,11} \right\}$ and $\unicode{x00a9} \left\{ {11,6} \right\}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{
      {11,\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {6,11} \right\}} \right\}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an equation for
      $\unicode{x00a9}\left\{ {m,n} \right\}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\unicode{x24}$  two numbers, it gives you the third number
      in the multiplication/
      division pattern. For example,
      $\unicode{x24}\{3,15\} = 75$, and $\unicode{x24}\{48,24\} = 12.$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find $\unicode{x24}\{2,3\}$, $\unicode{x24}\{12,13\}$, and
      $\unicode{x24}\{102,103\}.$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $\unicode{x24}\{2009,1\}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If $\unicode{x24}\{x,2\} = \unicode{x24}\{3,1\}$, then what is
      $x$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol $¤$ takes a single number, squares it, and then
      subtracts 4.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is $¤(6)?$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you ever get a negative answer
      for $¤(x)?$ Why or why not?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find an $x$ so that $¤(x)$ is
      divisible
      by 5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let the symbol $\unicode{xa5}$ mean: Add up the
      two numbers, then take that answer and subtract it from the
      product of the two numbers. What is $5\unicode{xa5}8$?  $8 \unicode{xa5} 5$?
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Look back at the problem above. Do you think the same
      thing would happen for any pair of numbers, if you used the
      same symbol? Explain your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When switching the order of the input numbers never has an
    effect on the answer, the symbol you are working with is said
      to have the <strong>commutative property</strong>. For example, the symbol $\unicode{xa5}$
    (from
    questions 15 and 16 above) had the commutative property, but
    the symbol © (from question 12)
    did not.</p>

    <p> One important thing to note is that there's no such thing as "sometimes" having the commutative property. For example, $\unicode{xa5}$ has the commutative property because
    $a\unicode{xa5}b$ and $b\unicode{xa5}a$ are equal for ANY
    input numbers $a$ and $b$, not just because it worked for 5 and
    8.</p>

    <p>Proving a statement false is as easy as finding one
    counterexample, but it is sometimes difficult to prove that a
    statement that appears to be true is indeed true. In the
    following problems (17-21), you will need to decide whether
    statements are true or false, and to also clearly support your
    position.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Fergie claims that each of the following symbols has the
      commutative property. Examine each of his claims.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x \Downarrow y$ means add 1 to $y$, multiply
      that answer by $x$, and then subtract $x$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Take two whole numbers $x$ and $y$.
      To do $x \% y$, you divide $x$ by 2, round down if it’s not a whole
      number, and then multiply by $y$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">To calculate $x\unicode{xa3} y$, imagine that you walk $x$ miles east and then $y$ miles northeast. $x\unicode{xa3}y$ is how far away you end up
      from your starting point.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\unicode{xbf}$ works by adding up the two numbers,
      multiplying that by the first number, and then adding the
      square of the second number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\unicode{xa2}$ takes two numbers.
      You reverse the first number (for instance, 513 becomes 315);
      one-digit numbers stay the same), then add the reversed
      number to the second number, and finally add up the digits of
      your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $x \unicode{x2605} y = x^2-y^2$. For example, $4 \unicode{x2605} 3 = 16-9 = 7$. True or false: $x \unicode{x2605}  y$ always equals the sum
      of the two numbers — for example, $4 \unicode{x2605} 3 = 7$ which equals $4 + 3$. If
      it’s true, justify your claim. If
      it’s false, try to find out what kinds of numbers do make the
      claim work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>When you give $\heartsuit$ two numbers, it finds the sum of the two
      numbers, then multiplies the result by the first number.
      Finally it subtracts the square of the first number. Flinch
      claims that $\heartsuit$ is commutative. Is he correct?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Here’s how you might prove Flinch’s claim in problem 19
      for $any$ two starting numbers.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Let’s call your first number $m$ and your second number $n$. Write down and simplify as much
      as you can the expression for $m \heartsuit n$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write down and simplify as much as
      you can the expression for $n \heartsuit m$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You should be able to convince anyone, using your work in
    problem 20 that Flinch’s statement is always true, no matter
    which numbers we start with.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is the rule below commutative?</p>
      
      <p>The rule $\unicode{x223c}$ adds up the two numbers, doubles the
      answer, multiplies the answer by the first number, then adds
      the square of the second number and subtracts the square of
      the first number.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let $x \clubsuit y = \frac{1}{{1,000,000,000}} \thinspace {x^y}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is there a value of $y$ such that
      $10 \clubsuit y &gt; 1$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is there a value of $y$ such that
      $1.001 \clubsuit y &gt; 1?$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The symbol “&amp;”, applied to $any$ two numbers (not only
      whole numbers), means that you take the first number and then
      add the product of the numbers.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">When you calculate $x$&amp;$y$, you
      get 120. What could $x$ and $y$ be? Give several different
      answers.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">When you calculate $x$&amp;$y$, you
      get 120. Write an equation that expresses this fact, then

      <p>It’s January 1st, and you are counting the days until your
      birthday. Let $m$ be the month (as a number between 1 and 12)
      and $d$ the day (between 1 and 31) of your birthday, and
      pretend that there are exactly 31 days in each month of the
      year.</p>

    <p>The rule $x \nabla y$ works by gluing $x$ and $y$ together. For example, $63 \nabla 998$ gives an answer of 63998. If $x$ and $y$ are both staircase numbers, and $x$ is bigger than $y$,
    is it always true that $x \nabla y$ is bigger than $y \nabla x$ ? If you think it’s
    always true, explain why. If not, explain what kind of input
    would make it true.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>John wishes to wear a nice pair of dress pants with a
    sport-coat when he goes out on his first date tonight. He has 5
    different pairs of dress pants and 3
    different sport-coats. John, wishing to make the best possible
    first impression, decides to try on each combination of a pair
    of dress pants and a sport-coat. After trying all of these
    combinations, he will decide which is the best. It will take
    him approximately five minutes to get dressed, look carefully
    at the jacket-pants combination, and then get undressed. If it
    is 5:30 p.m. now, and John wishes to be leaving his house by
    7:00 p.m., will he make it? It’s not hard to see that John
    should be interested in the number of jacket-pants combinations
    that he will be trying on. Determining this number is in the
    realm of an area of mathematics known as <em class="vocab">combinatorics</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">

    <p>John’s situation is one that can be reasonably solved by
    listing all of the possible combinations. This approach, while
    sufficient, is not particularly useful with the task that
    Imelda Marcos would have had. She reputedly had approximately
    3000 pairs of shoes, 2000 designer dresses, 500 bras, and 200

    <h2 class="new-page">Going Further</h2>

    <p>John’s and Imelda’s problems led to our first significant
    idea in combinatorics. If this was all there were to
    combinatorics, however, the subject would not be of much
    interest to mathematicians, computer scientists, or businesses,
    nor would this lesson have more pages in it (as you can plainly
    see that it does). Let’s look at some different situations from
    what we saw before.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The members of the Math Society wish to appoint a slate of
      officers that will be in charge of its meetings and
      activities this year. The slate will have 2 positions —
      President and Secretary. If there are 5 students in the Math
      Society, how many distinct slates can be formed? By distinct
      we mean to distinguish the slate consisting of Sheila
      (President)
      and Jack (Secretary) from the slate consisting of Jack
      (President) and Sheila (Secretary). You might think about
      visualizing in order to get a handle on how to count in this
      situation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose that the slate had 3 positions — President,
      Secretary, and Treasurer — and there were 6 students in the
      Math Society. How many distinct slates can be formed now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose that the Math Society expanded to 25 students and,
      therefore, decided that the governing body should have
      4 positions — President, Vice-President, Secretary, and
      Treasurer. How many distinct slates can be formed now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In how many different ways can Elsa arrange 5 books on
      the top shelf of her bookcase? She’s going to arrange them
      side-by-side and standing up.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In how many different ways can Elsa arrange 20 books on

    <p class="new-page">Your response to determining the exact amount in Problem 13
    might be to scream as you realize that you will have to
    write</p>

    <p>$20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18 \cdot 17 \cdot 16 \cdot 15 \cdot 14
    \cdot 13 \cdot 12 \cdot 11 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7
    \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1.$</p>

    <p>Fortunately, Christian Kramp in 1808 showed some foresight
    and decided to
    co-opt the exclamation mark for just this situation. Given the
    above problem, Christian would have written $20!$. (“$20!$” is read as “20 factorial.”)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write $9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3
      \cdot 2 \cdot 1$ using factorial notation. Write $6!$ without
      factorial notation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose we are going to create a 7-letter “word” by using
      the letters in the word “numbers”. The “word” doesn’t have to
      make sense.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many different 7-letter words
      can we create if a letter can be used more than once in a

      <p class="problem-part">What is the probability that a
      random 7-letter word created from the letters from “numbers”,
      where each of the letters could be used more than once, also
      happens to be a 7-letter word that uses each of the letters
      in “numbers” exactly once?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Problem 15 Part a could have been written using different,
    but equivalent, language. A common way of expressing this
    problem is to ask, “How many different 7-letter words can we
    create if repetition is not allowed?” The phrase “repetition is
    not allowed” means in this case that a letter cannot be used
    more than once in a word. Problem 15 Part b, similarly, could
    have been written, “How many different 7-letter words can we
    create if repetition is allowed?” Paying
    attention to whether repetition is allowed is critical when
    trying to understand what
    you are trying to count. In other words, you need to develop
    the habit of <em class="vocab">re-examine the problem</em> if you’re going to avoid
    undercounting or overcounting.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    
    <p>In each problem you should think very carefully about the
    information that’s been presented in order to determine what is
    relevant in solving the problem. Furthermore, you should
    consider
    visualizing — not necessarily with a tree diagram, but with
    slots or boxes — as a way of trying to organize the
    information. Lastly, if the numbers in the problem are large,
    don’t be afraid to change them to smaller numbers and,
    therefore, make the problem a little easier to work with
    initially. By doing this, you are using or developing an
    important habit called <em class="vocab">change or simplify the problem.</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Fill in the blanks to continue the pattern you see in this
      list:
      $2,\;7,\;6,\;11,\;10,\;15,\;\_\_\,,\;\_\_\,,\,\_\_\,,\;\_\_\,,
      \ldots $</p>
    </div>

    <p>In mathematics, a <em class="vocab">sequence</em> is a list of 
      numbers, usually
    with an identifiable
    pattern or a connection to real data — for example, the list of
    expected
    temperatures for the next ten days, or a sequence listing the
    profits that a
    business earned year by year.</p>

    <p>The numbers in the sequence are called <em class="vocab">terms</em>— for
    example, in the sequence above, 2 is the first term. Sometimes
    this pattern is very simple: $2,4,6,8…$. Other times it might be
    harder to spot, like the problem above. Or, it might be an
    unusual type of pattern — $0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1…$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with the next two numbers in the sequence
      $1,3,6,10, \ldots $, and a reason for why they should be the
      two numbers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How about the next two numbers in the sequence
      $2,5,10,13,26,29, \ldots ?$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make up a sequence that you think will challenge your
      neighbor — then see if they can find the pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A sequence starts with the numbers 5, 15, 35.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Describe a pattern that this
      sequence might be following, and give the next three terms
      according to the pattern.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now describe a different pattern
      that the sequence might be following, and give the next three
      terms according to the new pattern.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">The patterns you’ve seen so far have often been related to
    the differences
    between terms, such as the patterns in problems 1 and 2. When
    the pattern in a sequence is simply that the difference is
    always the same, the sequence is called an <em class="vocab">
    arithmetic
    sequence</em>. For example, $7,9,11,13…$ is one of these.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Some of the sequences below are arithmetic, and some are
      not. For each sequence, only a few terms are given.
      Identify
      whether or not the sequence appears to be arithmetic. Also
      for each sequence find a pattern and fill in the missing
      terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">3, 6, 12, 24, ___, ___, ….</p>

      <p class="problem-part">4, 11, 18, ___, ___, ….</p>

      <p class="problem-part">9, ___, 17, ___, 25, ….</p>

      <p class="problem-part">12, 13, 15, 16, 18, ___, ___,….</p>

      <p class="problem-part">47, 43, 39, ___, 31, ___, ___,
      ….</p>

      <p class="problem-part">13, 16, 22, 24, 28, 36, ___, ___,
      ___....</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>In a sequence, it’s not only the numbers that matter—the
    order of the numbers is important too. For instance, sequence
    “A” — 20, 10, 40, 30, 60, 50, … — follows quite a different pattern
    from sequence “B” — 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, …. — even though they
    contain all the same numbers.</p>

    <p>In the first sequence, 30 is the 4th term, while in the
    second sequence, 30 is
    the 3rd term. To make this type of thing easier to write, we’ll
    introduce some notation.</p>

    <p>In the first sequence, we write “${A_4} = 30$” (pronounced
    “A sub four” or simply “A four”) to mean that the sequence’s
    4th term is 30. Then the first sequence is called $\{ {A_n}\}$
    (because it is a set that consists of the terms ${A_1}$,
    ${A_2}$, ${A_3}$, etc) and the second sequence is called $\{
    {B_n}\} $.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Fill in the blanks according to the sequences below.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${A_1}$=_____.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${B_4}$=_____.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${B_{\_\_\_\_}}$= 30.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${A_{\_\_\_\_}}$= 70.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One last piece of notation you’ll need to know is that, in
    an arithmetic sequence, the constant difference between terms
    is often called “$d$”. In the sequence below, $d = 2$.</p>
    
    <p>7, 9, 11, 13, . . .</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In an arithmetic sequence called $\{ {T_n}\} $, if ${T_1}
      = 13$, and $d = 3$, then what does ${T_{10}}$ equal? What
      does ${T_{100}}$ equal?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In an arithmetic sequence, ${T_4} = 8$ and ${T_5} = 11$.
      Find the first three terms of the sequence.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An arithmetic sequence starts with ${T_1} = 4$, ${T_2} =
      9$, … Which term will equal 99?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What might the next two terms be in the sequence 4, 6, 9…?
      Find several different possible patterns.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make up five sequences all beginning with 1, 2, but with a
      different third term. Look at what others in your class came
      up with, as seeing different patterns can give you ideas for
      making up some really interesting sequences.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the sequence 5, 10, 6, 12, 8, 16, 12, 24, ...</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Find the repeating pattern, and
      write the next 3 terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">It looks like all of the numbers
      after the “5” are even —
      will the sequence ever produce another odd number?
      Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the three sequences below. Sequences $\{ {D_n}\}
      $ and $\{ {E_n}\} $ below have some missing information, but
      you can assume that they are arithmetic.</p>

    <p>You get a <em class="vocab">series</em> when you add up the terms

    $3 + 8 + 13 + 18$. In the following problems,
    you’ll develop clever ways to find the sum of a
    series without actually having to add every term
    individually — this way, if you have to add up a series that’s
    200 terms long, you won’t have to
    type 200 numbers into your calculator.</p>

  <section class="development">
    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content"><p>In a roomful of businesspeople, everyone
        wants to network with the others in the room. To achieve this, each
        person shakes hands with every other person in the room. If there are $n$
        people in the room, then, in terms of $n$, how many handshakes will
        occur?</p>
      </div> 
    </div>

    <p>When you solved this problem, you may have used the strategy
      of <em>change or simplify the problem</em>, trying
    the problem with four or five businesspeople
    and noticing the pattern. However you solved it, in order to
      generalize to $n$ people, you had to <em class="vocab">describe</em>, if only to
    yourself, a process by which you could count the number of
    handshakes. If you discussed this problem in class, you
    probably found yourself having to put this process into words
    very clearly, so that someone else following your process would
    also arrive at the correct answer: $(n - 1) + (n - 2) + (n - 3) \ldots
    + 1$.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, taking the time to describe something — a
    procedure, a set of data, an image, or a definition — can give
    you a deeper insight into the nature of the problem. The focus
    in this lesson
    will first be on writing thorough descriptions. In later
    problems, you will find that coming up with
    a complete description of a method for tackling
    the problem will be of use in solving it and other
    problems like it — as was the case with Problem 1.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
<p>Without looking up what a pentagon is, explain to a 5th
      grader how
      to tell if a shape is a pentagon. Remember that it might not
      even be
      a polygon. You can assume, however, that the shape is
      something
      that can be drawn with pencil and paper.</p></div>
    </div>


    <p>When you describe something, in order for your description
    to be as insightful as possible, you should have the following
    goals in mind:</p>

    <p>Your description should be <em>complete</em>, addressing all
    possibilities that could arise. In the problem above, did you
    take into account the fact that the shape might have curved
    lines? That it might have lines intersecting each other? Or
    even multiple lines intersecting at the same point as in the
    letter “K”.</p>

    <p>Your description should be <em>understandable</em> (to the
    intended reader). For example, you would be correct
    if you gave Wikipedia’s definition of a pentagon, “a
    five-sided polygon,” but this doesn’t do any good if the fifth
    grader doesn’t know what a polygon is.</p>

    <p>Your description should be <em>unambiguous</em>. This means that your
    description should be completely clear, and not open to any
    different interpretations. You should ask yourself, “Would it
    be possible for the reader to read my description carefully,
    but misunderstand what I mean?” For example, if you said “a
    pentagon must have five sides,” would someone reading the
    description think that this meant “exactly five sides” or “at
    least five sides”? If you think there is any possibility that
    your language might be misinterpreted, you should be more
    specific.</p>
    
  </section>
  <section class="problems">
    
    <p>Try this next exercise to practice writing a thorough
    description:</p>

    <div class="problem">Describe how to
      draw a lowercase letter “r”, to someone who’s never seen our
      alphabet. Once your description is complete, go on to the next
      problem.</div>

    <div class="problem"><p>The shapes below
      are some possible ways that the reader could draw an “r”
      incorrectly – make sure your description from the previous
      problem is clear enough that none of these mistakes could
      occur, and edit it if necessary.</p>
       

  	<figure>
    	<img src="../images/04-0-describe/diagram%204.tif.jpg" >
  	</figure>
 
  	</div>  

    <div class="problem">How would you
      explain what speed is to someone who doesn’t understand the
      phrase “how fast you’re going”?</div>

    <p>If you thought that the task of describing how to draw an r
    was a little bit silly, you’re right. Everyone in your class
    knows how to draw an r, and children who don’t know how to make
    an r are taught by example, not by description. Likewise, the
    chances are slim of your running into someone without a
    layperson’s understanding of speed.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the task of providing a basic description
    can be illuminating in its own right. It’s easy to believe that
    you understand what speed is, but when encouraged to define it
    for someone who doesn’t understand certain phrases, you’re
    likely to think more carefully about what speed actually is and
    therefore be able to use this understanding in future problems
    dealing with speed. Providing a careful description of
    something often helps you to understand it, bringing
    assumptions to light and revealing questions that you may not
    have known you had.</p>

    <p>With a few exceptions, the next batch of problems does not
    require you to pretend you have an audience with gaping holes
    in their knowledge. Instead, the problems are opportunities for
    you to practice writing complete, understandable, unambiguous
    descriptions targeted at people with a mathematics background
    similar to your own. In Problems 9 and 10 in particular,
    working towards a description that covers all the cases will
    guide your investigation.</p>

    <p>Targeting your explanations toward an audience of your peers
    will give you the chance to practice another virtue: making
    your descriptions <em>concise</em>. Charged with writing a complete
    description, people sometimes respond by using as many words as
    possible. But a beautiful description is thorough while at the
    same time using as few words as possible. Keep that in mind
    while working on the following problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">Last year you
      learned to solve a system
      of equations such as<br>
      $2x - 4y = 15$<br>
      $- 2x + 8y = - 1$<br>
      by adding the equations to each other in order to create a
      simpler equation that we could solve. Explain why we can solve
      the original system of equations by using this new, simpler
      equation in place of this system.</div>

    <div class="problem">In the standard
      window of your calculator
      to graph $y = \frac{{\left( {x + 2} \right)\left( {x + 3}
      \right)}}{{x + 3}}$. In the ZOOM menu choose the ZDecimal
      option. With this option, your calculator
      will set up a window where ${\rm{Xmin}} = - 4.7$,
      ${\rm{Xmax}} = 4.7$, ${\rm{Ymin}} = - 3.1$, and ${\rm{Ymax}}
      = 3.1$. Now, describe the graph of the equation and explain
      why it is this way.</div>

    <div class="problem">You learned in the
      Combinatorics lesson that the number of ways four people can
      stand in a line is 4x3x2x1=24. Describe a procedure they could
      use for systematically standing in all 24 configurations,
      without repeating any configuration.</div>

    <div class="problem">You may remember
      that the absolute value function $|x|$ takes an number x and
      makes it positive… so $|3| = 3$ and $| - 3| = 3$.

    <p class="problem-part"> Make a table of values, then use it to graph the equation
    $y = |x|$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> Make a table of values, then use it to graph the equation
    $y = |x - 3|$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> Describe the graph of $y = |x - h|$ clearly enough that,
    once you tell someone a specific value of $h$, they could draw
    the graph accurately.</p></div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An equation of the form $y = {x^n}$ is called a power
      function. $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^3}$ are two simple
      examples, with $n = 2$ and $n = 3$. Use your calculator to
      graph some different power functions, making sure you have
      chosen a sensible window. Describe the effect of the
      different values of $n$ on the graph. Make sure you try values
      of $n$ that are negative, fractional, etc. Try to categorize
      all the different types of graphs you can get depending on
      what $n$ is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe a circle to someone who’s never seen anything
      circular. You can either explain how to draw one, or define
      what it is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Do this problem with a partner. First, draw a meaningless
      shape on a piece of paper — just doodle for a few seconds,
      and make it look fairly random, but not too complicated.
      Don’t let your partner see the shape.</p>

      <p>Then, your partner should get a pen and paper, and you should
      describe what your shape looks like and have them try to draw
      it. Don’t look at what they’re drawing or make any gestures —
      just tell them what to do in words. At the end, look to see
      how accurately it turned out.</p>

<p>      You should each be the “describer” twice. Try to make your
      second try more accurate based on what you learned from your
      first try.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are even more benefits to providing a clear
    description! Not only can it help you convince others that your
    solution is correct, a clear, complete description can help you
    be sure that you haven’t overlooked anything in your solution
    to the problem. In addition, by doing problems such as the
    average speed or the four-people-in-a-line problem, you might
    have learned something deep about the nature of the concepts
    involved. Finally, you may find that, in providing a complete
    description of your solution to one problem, you may see a way
    to apply the solution to another problem.</p>

    <p>In the final set of problems, the description will no longer
    be the task itself. Each of these problems requires you to come
    up with a clear solution method. The trick will be to come up
    with a plan for solving each problem, after which the solution
    becomes much easier. As you work the problems, imagine
    explaining your solution method to your classmates. This will
    not only help you be ready to convince your classmates that
    your solution works, it will make sure that you are really
    honest about following your method.</p>

    <p>Don’t forget: after initially tinkering to get a feel for
    the problem, ask yourself, “what’s my plan?”</p>

      her money and spent \$360. The merchant found that she had \$240 at
      the end. How much money did she start with? Is there another

    <h2>Flu Season, Again.</h2>

    <p>One of the most unpleasant aspects of going to school is
    that when a few people get sick, they can transmit their
    illness to others very easily, and as a
    consequence most of the school can end up “catching” it.</p>

    <p>Epidemiologists, when faced with the spread of a disease,
    try to predict how quickly people will be infected by coming up
    with equations that seem to fit the data well. One reasonably
    accurate equation is called the logistic model, and is based on
    the following idea. Let $I$ stand for the number of people
    already infected and $N$ stand for the number who are not
    infected. Then the rate at which the disease is spreading is
    proportional to the product of $I$ and $N$. For the sake of
    simplicity let’s call this product the “disease quotient” of
    $DQ$. Let’s assume, also, that the $DQ$ is exactly equal to the
    product of $I$ and $N$. The $DQ$ is, therefore, a measure of how
    quickly the disease is spreading: the higher it is, the more
    people get infected that day.</p>

    <p>How would you expect $DQ$ to change while the disease is
    spreading? At what point during the spread of the disease would
    the disease spread most quickly?</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s look at a specific case — a local high school with 400
    students.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the $DQ$ when no students are infected? When 1
      student is infected? When 70 students are? When 300 are
      infected?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an expression describing the $DQ$ if one knows the
      number $x$ of students that are infected.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Rewrite the equation in Problem 2 so that it’s in the form
      $DQ = ax^2 + bx + c$. What are $a$, $b$, and $c$ in your equation?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Any equation that can be written in the form $y = a{x^2} +
    bx + c$, where $a \ne 0$, is called a <em class="vocab">quadratic
      equation</em>. In this lesson we will be looking at some algebraic
    tools that can be used to manipulate these equations so as to
    learn more about how the solutions of such an equation
    behave.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the number of people who are infected if $DQ =
      0$. You should get two answers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick one of your answers from problem 4 and explain why,
      without talking about the disease quotient or the number
      infected or not infected, it must be a solution to the
      equation $x(400-x) = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Think carefully about your answers to Problem 4 and how
      they solve the equation given in Problem 5. Now, explain why
      2 and -3/4 are solutions to the equation $\left( {4x + 3}
      \right)\left( {x - 2} \right) = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x\left( {x + 10} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {x - 3} \right)\left( {x +
      2} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {x + 5} \right)\left( {x +
      7} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$- 2\left( {x - 4} \right)\left(
      {x + 9} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\left( {x + 1} \right)^2}\left(
      {3x - 1} \right) = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$\left( {4x + 5} \right)\left( {x -
      3} \right)\left( {x + 1} \right) = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What must be true about $A$ or $B$ if $A \cdot B = 0$? Can
      the same thing be said if $A \cdot B = 8$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 8 you’re being asked to conjecture a very important theorem
    of mathematics that is often referred to as the <em class="vocab">Zero
      Product Property</em> — anytime you have a product, then it can equal
    zero only if at least one of its factors is zero.  This is a very powerful
    theorem in situations in which we can write an equation in the form
    ${\rm{BLAH}} = 0$, where BLAH can be written as a product. So, it seems
    useful here to focus on how to write expressions as products, don’t you
    think?</p>

    <p>There is a way to rewrite expressions ${x^2} + 7x + 10$ as a product of two expressions, so that it looks like $(x+\ldots)(x+ \ldots )$.  You may have seen this technique before: it is called  
    <em class="vocab">factoring</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Working on your own or with your peers, factor ${x^2} + 7x
      + 10$. When you have an answer, look carefully
      at your factored form of the expression and how it relates to
      the original expression.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve the equation ${x^2} + 7x + 6 = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations by factoring.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 3x + 2 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x^2 + 8x + 12 =0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x^2 + 20x + 64 =0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 6x + 9 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 5x - 14 = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 11 Part e, you needed to resort to negative numbers in order to factor the expression. Try to notice number patterns you see in the original expression and its factored form. Then try the following problems. </p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Factor each of the following expressions.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 4x - 45$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - 5x - 36$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - x - 42$</p>
    </div>

    <p>Factoring is not a process reserved
    for expressions like ${x^2} + 6x + 8$, but can also be done on
    expressions like $3{x^2} + 7x$. In essence, factoring is a
    process devoted to reversing distribution: can we rewrite
    $3{x^2} + 7x$ so that its factored form, when multiplied out,
    would give us back $3{x^2} + 7x$?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Factor $3{x^2} + 7x$. Check your work by doing the
      distribution.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Solve each of the following equations by factoring.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$2x - 5{x^2} = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$6{x^2} + 4x = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$5{x^3} - 12{x^2} = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^3} - 8{x^2} + 16x = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Kyle is managing an upcoming concert at school and is
      concerned about the income generated by the concert just
      through ticket sales. Over the years he has come to realize
      that when the price of the ticket increases, the number of
      people willing to attend goes down. He knows that all 360
      students will attend if the concert is free, but for each $1
      increase in the price of the ticket, 20 fewer students will
      attend.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many students will attend if
      Kyle charges \$2 per ticket? How many if he charges \$5?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What income will Kyle generate if
      he charges \$2 per ticket? What if he charges \$8?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an expression for the income
      $I$ generated by the concert when the price of the ticket is $p$.
      Is this a quadratic equation?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Set the expression in Part c equal
      to zero and solve this equation. Explain the meaning of the

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 3x - 28$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - 7x - 18$</p>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph the equation you came up with in Problem 2 on a
      calculator. (If you have trouble seeing the graph, take a
      look at the values you computed in Problem 1.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the graph in Problem 18 to determine when the $DQ$ is
      25600. Explain why both of your answers make sense in terms
      of the spread of a disease.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many people have been infected if $DQ = 20000$?</p>

      this point?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Explain how you can use your answers to Problem 19 to
      solve Problem 21. Could you have used the answers from
      Problem 20 to solve problem 21?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The two numbers that you calculated in Problem 21 serve as the
    coordinates of a specific point on the graph of the $DQ$ equation. The
    graph of the equation is called a <em class="vocab">parabola</em>, and the
    point that you calculated in Problem 21 is called the <em
      class="vocab">vertex</em> of the parabola. The vertex can be thought of
    as the point where the parabola
    turns.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The graph of $DQ = x(400-x)$ is symmetric over a vertical line. Write an

      <p>An answer to Problem 15 Part c could be $I = p\left( {360 - 20p}

    </div>

    <p>You may recall that the points you found in Problem 25 are
      referred to as the <nobr>$p$-intercepts</nobr> of the graph of $I = p\left(
      {360 - 20p} \right)$. They would be called the <nobr>$x$-intercepts,</nobr>
    if the horizontal axis had been labeled with $x$. Notice that if
    you determine the intercepts on the horizontal axis of a
    parabola then you can determine the axis of symmetry and the
    vertex of the parabola.</p>

      in it as possible.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In Lesson 1 of this chapter you saw several different
    quadratic models. Two of these models were $y = - {x^2} +
    400x$ and $y = - 20{x^2} + 360x$. These models are
    different in the sense that the equations look different, but
    are their graphs different, too?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Set the window dimensions of your calculator to
      ${\rm{Xmin}} = - 50$, ${\rm{Xmax}} = 400$, ${\rm{Xscl}} =
      50$, ${\rm{Ymin}} = - 5000$, ${\rm{Ymax}} = 40000$, and ${\rm{Yscl}} =
      5000$. Now, graph $y = - 20{x^2} + 360x$ and $y = - {x^2} + 400x$. What
      do you see? Are the graphs identical to each other?</p>
    </div>

    <p>While the graphs were not identical, they were both
    parabolas. When we studied transformations we learned that we
    can take a triangle, for example, and transform it into a
    triangle of the same shape but a different size and in a
    different place. We also learned that we can stretch a triangle
    in just one direction and change its shape while still
    preserving the fact that it’s a triangle. A natural
    question at this point might be the following: Can the graphs
    of the two
    parabolas seen in Problem 1 be transformed into each other? Put
    another way: Is it possible to take the graph of $y = - {x^2}
    + 400x$ and shift it, stretch it, or flip it over some line in
    order to get it to be identical to the graph of $y = - 20{x^2}
    + 360x$? Rather than tackle this actual question now, we
    will
    examine a similar problem by looking at simpler equations.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use the standard window to graph the quadratic
      function
      $y = {x^2}$ on your calculator. The standard window has
      ${\rm{Xmin}} = - 10$, ${\rm{Xmax}} = 10$, ${\rm{Xscl}} = 1$, ${\rm{Ymin}} = - 10$, ${\rm{Ymax}} = 10$, and
      ${\rm{Yscl}} = 1$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For what values of $x$ does the
      graph, as you move from left to right, go down? go up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Why does the graph not appear in
      the 3rd or 4th quadrants?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The previous questions were designed to help you get a feel
    for the shape of the graph of $y = {x^2}$. Often it helps to
    have this kind of feel before you start to
    investigate how you can transform this shape. So, now that you
    have a feel for this graph, let’s look at some transformations
    of it.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the same window you graphed $y = {x^2}$, graph $y =
      {x^2} + 3$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Do the graphs appear congruent —
      the exact same size and shape?</p>

    <p>The completed table in Problem 3 Part b should lead you to
    think that the graphs of $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^2} + 3$ really
    are congruent to each other,
    differing only in their location. It’s important to note that
    we haven’t proven
    this to be true; we’ve only gathered evidence that supports
    this notion.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In what direction should you shift the graph of $y =
      {x^2}$ so that it would exactly coincide with the graph of $y
      = {x^2} + 3$?
      By how much should the graph be shifted? You should be able
      to give a precise answer to this.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One way of answering Problem 4 is by saying that the graph
    of $y = {x^2} + 3$ is a vertical translation up 3 units of the
    graph of $y = {x^2}$. There is synonymous language — vertical
    shift up 3 units, for example. Don’t worry about using the
    exact same terms that everyone else is using when trying to
    describe the transformation that has occurred, but do worry
    about whether your language is accurate.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the standard window graph $y = {x^2}$, $y = {x^2} + 6$, $y = {x^2} - 2$, and $y = {x^2} - 10$. Thinking about
      what you wrote in Problem 4, and what you read in the
      above
      paragraph, what conjecture can you make regarding the graphs
      of $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^2} + k$? Be specific.</p>

      be the equation of this new graph?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph $y = {x^2}$, $y = 3{x^2}$, and $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2$ in the standard
      window. Make sure you can see all of the important features
      of each of the graphs. Now, describe how you would
      transform the graph of $y = {x^2}$ into each of the other
      graphs. Be as precise as possible.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are many possible answers to Problem 7. A very common
    one is to say that you would horizontally compress (make
    narrower) toward the $y$-axis the graph of $y = {x^2}$ in order
    to get the graph of $y = 3{x^2}$ and horizontally stretch (make
    wider) away from the $y$-axis the graph of $y = {x^2}$ in order
    to get the graph of  $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2$. Sometimes a person who describes the
    changes in this way will go on to write that the graph of $y =
    {x^2}$ would be compressed by a factor of 3 (made 1/3 as small)
    in the first case and stretched by a factor of 2 in the second
    case. It’s not easy checking the accuracy of these statements,
    but as it turns out, these statements about the factors are not
    quite right. Let’s look at another way of transforming the
    graph of $y = {x^2}$ into the graph of $y = 3{x^2}$ or the
    graph of  $y=\frac{1}{2}x^2$.</p>

    <p>In Problems 3-6 we saw that if you add a quantity (positive
    or negative) to ${x^2}$ the graph of the new equation will
    shift vertically. Since 3 is multiplying ${x^2}$ in the
    equation $y = 3{x^2}$, let’s see whether the graph of $y =
    {x^2}$ changes vertically. In order to do this it’s best that
    we plug the same $x$-values into each equation and compare
    corresponding $y$-values.</p>

    <p>
    You may have noticed that it’s quite tedious to keep saying
    that the graph has been vertically stretched “away from the
    $x$-axis” or compressed “toward the $x$-axis”. In Chapter 1 you
    learned that there is a simple formula that describes dilations
    or compressions if they are done around $\left( {0,0} \right)$.
    Throughout this lesson, we will be seeking simple, formulaic
    ways of describing vertical stretching or shrinking, so we will
    always take the $x$-axis as the line from which we stretch or
    toward which we compress. Hence, we will say, “the graph of $y
    = 3{x^2}$ is a vertical stretch by a factor of 3 of the graph
    of $y = {x^2}$”; there’s no need to mention the $x$-axis.</p>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph $y = {x^2}$ and $y = (x-4)^2$ in the same window on your
      calculator. Make sure you can see complete graphs of each of
      the functions. Describe as precisely as possible how you can
      transform the graph of $y = {x^2}$ into the graph of $y = (x-4)^2$.</p>
    </div>

    <p> You may have noticed in Problem 22 that the two graphs appear to be the
    same size and shape but are in different places along the $x$-axis. In this
    sense the graphs look like they’re horizontal translations of each other.
    One way of determining the precise magnitude and direction (left or right)
    of this translation is to focus on where the vertex is on each graph.
    Since these points correspond to each other — in the same way that the
    corner points of two triangles would correspond to each other — you can
    probably figure out what the horizontal translation is by looking at these
    points. The diagram below shows the two graphs, along with their indicated
    vertices.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/04-2-transformations/9-4-2%20diagram%2022.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <p>From this diagram we can see that the graph of $y = (x-4)^2$ appears to
    be 4 units to the right of the graph of $y = {x^2}$. So, if we horizontally
    translate the graph of $y = {x^2}$ to the right 4 units we can get the
    graph of $y = {\left( {x - 4} \right)^2}$. Notice that though the equation
    indicates that 4 is being subtracted from $x$, the graph moves <em>right</em> 4
    units, not left 4 units. Let’s look at a few more graphs before we
    investigate this apparently strange behavior.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph $y = {x^2}$ and $y = (x+3)^2$ in the same window. Describe how you
      would transform the graph of $y = {x^2}$ in order to get the
      graph of $y = (x+3)^2$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Without using your calculator describe how you would
      transform the graph of $y = {x^2}$ in order to get the graph

      it into the graph of $y = {\left( {x - 7} \right)^2}$?
      Check your work by using your calculator.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Problems 23 and 24 probably confirmed your sense of what was
    going on in Problem 22, not only in
    that the transformation is horizontal but also that it is
    “opposite” of what you might expect just from looking at the
    equation. One way of trying to understand what’s going on here
    is to isolate the variable that appears to be affected by the
    transformation — the “$x$” variable — by controlling the values
    of the other variable — the “$y$” variable. We can do this by
    creating a table in which the y-values are the same for each
    equation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Complete the table below. For some $y$-values there are two
      values of $x$ that could go into the box. Write only one of
      these $x$-values. Also, you’ll need to think about which
      $x$-value you want to write if you want to uncover a

Lesson 3:


Completing The Square 
</h1>
          
          
          

<article>

  <section class="development">

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In Lesson 1 you investigated how to solve quadratic
    equations like $5\left( {x + 3} \right)\left( {x - 7} \right) =
    0$ or $x^2 - 3x - 28 = 0$. You can use the Zero Product
    Property to solve the first equation, but you’ll need to factor
    (reverse distribution)
    the second equation before you can use that property to solve
    this equation.
    It’s really nice, in fact, when you can use factoring as a way
    of transforming an equation into another form that is easier to
    analyze. Unfortunately, you also saw a few equations that did
    not readily yield to factoring. Below are some equations of
    this type:</p>
    
    <p>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li> ${x^2} + 4x + 2 = 0,$ </li>
  		<li> ${x^2} - 6x + 6 = 0,$ and  </li>
        <li> ${x^2} + 10x - 20 = 0$ </li>
  </ul>
	</p>


    <p>Notice that had these equations initially been derived from
    the equations shown below —</p>

    <p>
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li> $y = {x^2} + 4x + 2,$ </li>
  		<li> $y = {x^2} - 6x + 6,$ and  </li>
        <li> $y = {x^2} + 10x - 20$ </li>
  </ul>
</p>

    <p>—you would not be able to use factoring as a way of
    determining the exact values of the $x$-intercepts. You would
    be able to approximate them with your calculator but never get
    the exact values for them. You actually do know a way — a
    process — of solving this problem, however. Let’s take a look
    at a process that will get you the exact values.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>There are two values of $x$ that satisfy the equation
      ${x^2} = 9$. What are they? These are called the <em class="vocab">solutions</em>
      of the equation.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The two numbers you found in Problem 1 are each called a
    <em class="vocab">square root</em> of 9.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What are the solutions to ${x^2} = 49$? What are the
      square roots of 49?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What are the solutions to ${x^2} = 50$? What are the
      square roots of 50?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If your answers to problem 3 were 7.071067812 and
    -7.071067812 (or shorter versions of one or both of these
    numbers) then you did not find the exact
    solutions. These numbers are <em>approximations</em> of the square roots
    of 50.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Explain why $7.07106781^2$ 
      cannot equal 50.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Given your answer to Problem 4, then, you may wonder why
    your calculator indicates that the square of 7.071067812 is 50.
    Your calculator does this because it cannot hold onto enough
    digits to show you what this squared number actually is. A more
    powerful calculator could show you that ${7.071067812^2} =
    50.000000001902467344$. Pretty close to 50, but not quite!
    The fact is that there is no way to write down the exact value
    of the positive square root of 50 by using decimal
    notation.</p>

    <p>When we want to indicate the exact solutions to the equation
    ${x^2} = 50$, or the exact square roots of 50, we just write
    $\sqrt {50} $ to indicate the positive square root of 50 and $- \sqrt {50} $ to indicate the negative square root of 50. Keep
    this in mind when you’re being asked to determine the exact
    solutions to an equation and you need to find square roots in
    order to do this.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the exact solutions to each equation.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} = 16$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - 20 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$(x-2)^2 = 9$</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you weren’t sure what to do in Problem 5 Part c think
    about replacing the
      <nobr>“$x - 2$”</nobr> with $A$, solve for $A$, and then figure out what
    $x$ would be from there. Try Problem 5 Part c again if you
    didn’t correctly solve it the first time.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the exact solution to each equation.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\left( {x + 3} \right)^2} =
      10$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\left( {x - 6} \right)^2} - 25 =
      0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\left( {x + 1} \right)^2} - 35 =
      0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\left( {x - 10} \right)^2} + 45 =
      56$</p>
    </div>

    <p>At this point you should have a pretty good idea about how
    to solve quadratic equations that are in the form ${\left( {x -
    h} \right)^2} - k = 0$. So, if you can take an equation
    like


    $${x^2} + 4x + 2 = 0$$

    and rewrite it in the form

   $${\left( {x - h} \right)^2} - k = 0$$

    Then you would be able to solve the original equation since
    you know how to solve an equation in this last form. So, let’s
    figure out how to get a quadratic equation of the form ${x^2} +
    bx + c = 0$ into the form ${\left( {x - h} \right)^2} - k =
    0$.</p>

      <p>Look carefully at each equation in the right column of the
      table in Problem 7 and compare it to its corresponding
      equation in the left column of the table. Look at one row at
      a time and see if you can pick up on any patterns between the
      equation on the right and its partner on the left. Once you
      have come up with some patterns try to use one or more of
      them to rewrite the equation below so that it is in the form
      ${\left( {x - h} \right)^2} - k = 0$ (Form V in the table
      above).</p>

<p>      ${x^2} + 8x + 1 = 0$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Once you have rewritten the equation in Problem 8 solve it
      the same way that you solved the equations in Problem 6.
      Check your answers in the original equation to make sure that
      they work.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The process of adding a constant to the terms ${x^2} + bx +
    c$ so that the resulting expression can be factored as a
    perfect square is called <em class="vocab">completing the square.</em> As you can see
    in Problems 8 and 9, completing the square can be used to solve
    quadratic equations that don’t appear to factor.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use completing the square to solve the following
      equations. Find exact solutions.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$x^2 + 12x - 21 = 0$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} + 2x - 4 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - 4x + 1 = 0$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${x^2} - 20x - 100 = 0$</p>
    </div>

    <p>In Problem 10 the solutions you were finding are called the
    <em class="vocab">roots</em> of the equation since each equation is in the form
    ${\rm{BLAH}} = 0$. As you’ve seen before, these roots (these
      solutions) can be interpreted as $x$-intercepts of a
    corresponding quadratic function. For example, the roots of the
      equation ${x^2} + 12x - 21 = 0$ are the <nobr>$x$-intercepts</nobr> of $y = {x^2} + 12x - 21$. As
    it turns out, the values of $x$ that make $y$ equal to zero are
    called the <em class="vocab">zeros</em> of the function. And, as you learned in
    <cite>Quadratic Models and Algebra</cite>, these zeros can be used to
    determine the exact coordinates of the vertex.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the exact zeros of the following quadratic
      functions.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$y = {x^2} + 6x - 1$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$y = x^2 - 10x + 4$</p>

      <p>Use the information you have developed in Problems 11 and

      on your graph, the exact coordinates of the vertex, the
      $x$-intercepts, and the $y$-intercept.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You should pat yourself on the back after completing Problem
    13. You not only can fully analyze a linear function ($y = ax +
    b$): solve it, graph it, find its slope and intercepts without
    the calculator; you now have some ideas about how to fully
    analyze a quadratic function of the form $y = {x^2} + bx + c$. Later, we
    will get to analyzing the more general form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, where $a$
    can be any real number other than zero, and we will even look at what
    happens when there don’t appear to be any zeros (it turns out that there
    are zeros, but they are of a completely different nature).</p>

      <p>This curriculum was written by members (past and present) of the upper 
school math department at the Park School of Baltimore. This was possible 
thanks to Park School’s F. Parvin Sharpless Faculty and Curricular 
Advancement (FACA) program, which supports faculty every summer in major 
curricular projects. In addition to the support of FACA by the Nathan L. 
Cohen Faculty Enhancement fund and the Joseph Meyerhoff FACA fund, this 
project was also funded by grants from the E. E. Ford Foundation, the 
Benedict Foundation, Josh and Genine Fidler, and an anonymous donor.</p>

      <p>At Arnaldo’s small party, people shook hands with as many
      people they liked, from 0 up to everyone else at the party.
      Nayla has been paying close attention, and says that if you
      add up everyone’s personal “handshake total”, you will get
      15. Can she be correct? Explain.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p>Often in life, when someone says something that seems
    surprising, counter-intuitive, or even reasonable, we will look
    not at the conviction with which the speaker is speaking, but
    instead for the evidence and reasoning needed to back up their
    claim. In mathematics, we do the same thing. It is a fun fact
    of mathematics that many things that initially appear to be
    false are in fact true, and as well many things that appear to
    be true are false. So the only way to know if a statement is
    correct is to use clear reasoning based on assumptions we all
    agree upon.</p>

    <p>Proving is a way of demonstrating to yourself and others
    that something you think may be true (or false), must in fact
    be true (or false). Although there are many different ways of
    proving a statement, everyone agrees that the steps of a proof
    should be clear: a careful reader should be able to read each
    step of your proof and see how it connects and follows from the
    one before. That way, at the conclusion of your proof, they
    will agree with you!</p>

    <p>In the “Arnaldo’s party” problem above, at first it may seem
    a bit mystifying how to approach testing Nayla’s claim.
    Probably the best thing to do at first is to Tinker by trying
    to see if you can get a “handshake total” for all party members
    to be equal or close to 15. If you can get to exactly 15,
    you’re done; Nayla is correct, and the problem is over. On the
    other hand, if you have tried a number of different handshake
    “scenarios” and only gotten close to 15 in each case,
    nevertheless you will probably have noticed something
    interesting about handshake totals in general—something you
    might try to prove (and which will tell us if Nayla can be
    correct as well).</p>

    <p>So, when presented with a claim, do three things. First,
    decide whether it seems reasonable – do you believe it at first
    glance? Next, try to find evidence that the claim is or is not
    true. Finally, for any claim that you believe to be true, try
    to prove that it’s true by making a sequence of logical
    statements, each of which your peers could understand and agree
    to; and for any claim you believe to be false, provide an
    example that shows the claim is false—such an example is called
    a counterexample.</p>

    <p>Here’s a problem that many students have enjoyed:</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
      <figure class="fig-50">  
       <img src="../images/09-0-prove/Prove checkerboard.png">
      </figure>
      <p>A 64-square black and white checkerboard (see above) can
      clearly be completely covered by 32 dominos. If the top right
      and bottom left squares are removed, what is left is a
      62-square board. How many dominoes will be required to cover
        the 62-square board?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
      <p>[Continuation of problem 2] Did you check your answer to
      problem 2? A 64 square checkerboard is covered by 32 dominoes
      since every domino covers 2 squares, a white one and a black
      one. In the altered checkerboard, how many black squares are
      there? How many white squares? Would 31 dominoes do the
      job?</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s another problem that might seem very tricky at first,
    but with a little persistence and some tinkering . . .</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
      <p>In a stock market game, Traci claims that she can purchase
      any stock above $\$26$ by using only $\$5$ and $\$6$ coupons. (For
      example, there is no way she could purchase $\$13$ of stock with
      these coupons, but she could purchase $\$41$ of stock by using
      one $\$6$ coupon and seven $\$5$ coupons.) Do you think that Traci
      can really pull this off?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p>As a token of our affection to you, the answer is given on
    the reverse.</p>

    <p class="new-page">While it may seem plausible that there is always some
    combination of $\$5$ and $\$6$ coupons that is equivalent to a
    specific amount of money, it at first seems unlikely that we
    may be able to prove that any amount over $\$26$ can be produced
    by some combination of the two coupons. How would we know for
    sure that $\$329876$ could be paid out?</p>

    <p>Our best strategy is to begin by tinkering, and then see if
    there are any interesting patterns that emerge. We can then try
    to establish through careful reasoning that the patterns we see
    are no fluke, that they have to continue.</p>

    <p>So let’s start.</p>

    <p>The first few dollar amounts one can figure out just by
    tinkering:</p>

    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$28$ stock can be paid by using two $\$5$ coupons and three $\$6$

    <p>$\$30$ stock can be paid by using no $\$5$ coupons and five $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$31$ stock can be paid by using five $\$5$ coupons and one $\$6$
    coupon.</p>

    <p>Wait a second. Isn’t this sort of tedious? Doesn’t it seem
    like this approach would take us forever, and even then we
    would still have an infinity of numbers left to check? And
    weren’t we supposed to look for a pattern? There doesn’t seem
    to be any pattern in the $\$5$’s and $\$6$’s at all.</p>

    <p>Well, let’s think about a $\$32$ stock. Traci knows how to
    purchase a $\$27$ stock—three $\$5$ coupons and two $\$6$ coupons. What
    coupon should she now add in order to purchase a $\$32$ stock?</p>

    <p>Now convince yourself that Traci’s claim is valid.</p>

  <section class="development">


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>An explorer is lost in the 30 by 60 mile rectangular section
    of snowy wilderness shown below. The search and rescue team
    knows that she started her journey at the southwest corner, and
    since there hasn’t been any new snow for a while, they also
    know that they’ll be able to see her tracks.</p>
    
 <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/09-1-algorithms/Wilderness.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Obviously, the team wants to find the lost explorer as
    quickly as possible. There are different ideas about how to do
    this, though, so they decide to split into
    two groups. Group A will start at the southwest corner and
    simply follow the explorer’s trail. Group B, though, has a
    different strategy. Here’s what they do:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Group B starts out at $\left( {0,30} \right)$, and
      walks directly east. Every
      time they cross the explorer’s trail, they make a note of it.
      Suppose that by the time they reach the eastern border,
      they’ve crossed the explorer’s trail 5 times. What can they
      conclude about where the explorer must be now? How about if
      they’d crossed the trail 8 times?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>As you can see, Group B’s west-to-east walk allows them to
      cut the remaining search area in half. Their idea is to keep
      repeating this until they’ve narrowed down the search area to
      a small horizontal strip. Suppose that on the first walk
      (along $y = 30$), they crossed the trail 3 times.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What horizontal line should they
      walk next?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, suppose that on the second
      walk, they cross the
      explorer’s trail 6 times. Where could the explorer possibly
      be? Demonstrate your answer by drawing a picture of one such
      trail the explorer could have taken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem allow-break">

      <p>Is Group B’s strategy better than Group A’s? To help you
      answer this question, determine approximately how long each
      one would take to find the lost explorer in each of
      the following scenarios. (Assume that each group moves at the
      same speed, and that as soon as a group comes within
      a mile or so, they’ll see the explorer’s signal flares.)</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>The two strategies in the situation above are both examples
      of <em class="vocab">algorithms</em>— though, of course, Group A’s is a rather
    simple one. An <em class="vocab">algorithm</em> is simply a clearly defined,
    step-by-step process for accomplishing a desired task. You can
    think of every algorithm as having three main parts: input,
    process and output. In the search and rescue situation, for
    example, the input would be the whole search area and the
    explorer’s trail, and the output would be the explorer’s
    location.</p>

    <p>As you can hopefully see, thinking about and analyzing
    algorithms can be
    useful in situations where there are multiple possible
    approaches, and we want the “best” or most efficient one. But
    this kind of thinking isn’t only useful in practical
    applications — it’s also a source of some classic games and
    puzzles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The Number Devil is thinking of an integer between 1 and
      63 (inclusive), and your job is to guess it. If you guess
      wrong, the Number Devil will tell you (truthfully) whether
      your guess is too low or too high. Come up with a strategy
      for finding the Number Devil’s number in as few guesses as
      possible.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Was there anything in common between your strategy in the
    previous problem and Group B’s approach to finding the missing
    explorer? Group B’s strategy — and, likely, yours — is an
    example of a <em class="vocab">binary search</em> algorithm. (The Latin root $bini$ means “two-by-two”.) Here’s another application of it.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your English teacher has an alphabetized stack of 15
      papers,
      but she’s forgotten whose papers she collected. Now, she
      needs to check and see if she has Gabi’s paper in the stack.
      She decides to use a binary search algorithm.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Simulate this with your group: have
      a group member make an alphabetized list of names without
      showing you. The list maker gets to decide whether or not
      “Gabi” is in the list. You, in the role of the teacher, can
      ask for any individual name in the list (e.g., “Who is the
      fifth person in the list?”). How many times do you have to
      ask before you can be sure whether or not Gabi’s name is in
      the stack?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make up an alphabetized list of 15
      names that would
      force the teacher’s binary search process to make the most
      guesses possible. This is called a “worst case” input for
      the
      algorithm. How many guesses does the algorithm take,
      in the worst case?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, you decide to play a little trick on the teacher.
      Carefully rearrange the ordering of names you made in part
      b of the previous problem so that, when your teacher uses
      binary search, she’ll end up mistakenly concluding that
      Gabi’s paper is not in the stack.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Based on what happened in problem 6, it’s clear that there
    are certain situations in which the binary search algorithm
    isn’t appropriate. This is always true: every algorithm makes
    some assumptions about its input.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What assumption(s) did the teacher make in using her
      binary search algorithm?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">In addition to thinking carefully about the input, it’s also
    helpful when working with algorithms to identify the <em class="vocab">basic operations</em> your algorithm can use. The basic operations are
    always based on the situation you’re dealing with: they are
    the
    actions you’re able to do as a single “step” of your algorithm.
    In the Number Devil game, for example, your basic operation was
    to guess a number and find out if it was correct, too big, or
    too small. In the stack of papers example,
    the basic operation was to check the name on a single paper in
    the stack and compare it alphabetically with the name ‘Gabi’.
    The basic operation in the
    following game is similar to these two, but slightly
    different.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Play the following game with a classmate:</p>
    

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Your partner should write
    five different numbers on slips of paper. Then shuffle the
    papers and put them face down on the table in a straight
    row.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">You are the guesser. Your
    job is to figure out which paper has the largest number written
    on it. But you can never
    see the numbers themselves — you can only ask for
    comparisons. For example, you could point to the first
    slip and the fourth slip, and your classmate would have
    to tell you which one has the larger number.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Each comparison counts as
    one step, and your goal is to find the paper with the largest
    number with as few steps as possible.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Play the game and identify the paper
    with the largest
    number. How many steps did it take before you were
    certain about your answer?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Describe, in detail, an algorithm for
    finding the largest
    number in a list of numbers, using as few comparisons
    as possible.</p>
      
      </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Aaron has an algorithm that he claims can find the largest
      number every time using only three comparisons. Either figure
      out Aaron’s algorithm, or explain why it’s impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Here’s a somewhat different algorithmic puzzle that many
    consider a “modern classic.” (In fact, the story goes that,
    before it got out onto the Internet, this was a question that
    Google interviewers asked of potential employees.)</p>

    <p>You have two perfectly identical eggs. You need to figure
    out how high an egg can fall from a 100-story building before
    it breaks. You know nothing about the toughness of the eggs;
    they may be very fragile and break when dropped from the first
    floor. On the other hand, they may be super tough genetically
    altered eggs, so tough that that dropping them from the 100th
    floor doesn’t even cause a scratch. The only thing you know for
    sure is that they both have exactly the same “toughness.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Joey takes his first egg, and drops it off of the fourth
      floor. It doesn’t break. Then, he goes up and drops it off
      the tenth floor, and it shatters spectacularly on the
      sidewalk. Finally, he takes his second (and last) egg, and
      drops it off the seventh floor. It breaks. What can Joey
      conclude about the toughness of his eggs?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a strategy for figuring out your eggs’
      toughness. Your job is to guarantee the smallest
      number of egg-drops, in the worst case. You are
      allowed to break both eggs, but remember, two is all
      you get!</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You have 16 identical-looking coins. Fifteen of them have
      exactly the same weight, and one is too heavy. Describe
      an algorithm for finding the heavy coin in as few steps as
      possible. The basic operation allowed is to use a simple
      balance to compare 2 piles of coins to see which pile is
      heavier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the algorithm you use for adding two very large numbers
      by hand, what are the basic operations? How about multiplying
      two numbers by hand? Dividing?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe the mental algorithm a street vendor might
      use
      to quickly make change for a $\$20$ bill. Make sure your

      $\$1.50$, $\$3.00$, $\$11.45$, $\$17.26$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an algorithm for finding someone’s age based on
      their birth date and the current date. (For instance, Tom’s

      years old.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Recall the Number Devil game from problem 4. Now let’s say
      you’re trying to guess a number between 1 and 255. If you
      were going to play using the binary search algorithm, what
      would be one worst-case number that the Number Devil could
      choose?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the following strategy to the egg-drop
      problem:</p>
  
    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow"><em>Starting at floor 1,
    drop the first egg off of odd-numbered floors until it breaks.
    Then, go back down one floor and drop the second egg. If it
    breaks, that’s the answer. If not, then the floor above is the
      answer.</em></p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Say you get to decide how
    tough the eggs are, and you want to force the strategy above to
    make the largest possible number of drops before it
    succeeds.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What is the worst-case
    input for this strategy?
    i.e., how tough should you make the eggs?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> What’s the worst-case
    number of drops?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <p>The algorithms we’ve worked with so far dealt with lists of
    information, whether they were lists of numbers, names, phone
    numbers, etc. Now, we’re going to look at algorithms that
    transform a single item, such as a number, word, etc.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You and your friend are planning to share lockers, so as
      soon as you get your combinations, you plan to exchange them
      over the phone. Each combination has three numbers in it –
      for example, 11 – 2 – 41.</p>

      <p>In case someone might be listening, though, you agree ahead
      of time to use the following algorithm to encrypt each number
      in the combination:</p>

      <p>      ${\mathop{\rm EncryptNumber}\nolimits} \left( N \right)$:</p>
      <p>If $N$ is odd, then output $2 + N$.<br>
      Otherwise, output $2 \cdot N$.</p>
 

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Notice that the notation
    being used here is similar to the “function notation” that
    you’ve seen in some previous
    lessons. “EncryptNumber” is the name of the algorithm, and $N$ is
    a name for the input to the algorithm.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your combination is 12 – 7 – 11. What
    should you tell
    your friend?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your friend tells you 80 – 28 – 29.
    What was her
    combination?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your brother wants to use the same system with his friend,
      but he’s confused about how it’s possible to “decrypt” the
      numbers he receives. Give him detailed instructions for a
      “DecryptNumber” algorithm that he can use to understand what
      his friend tells him.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One convenient feature of using function notation is that we
    can use it to easily write down things about what an algorithm
    does for specific inputs. For example, we can write
    ${\rm{EncryptNumber}}\left( 4 \right) = 8$, or
    ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( 8 \right) = 4$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {13} \right)$? How
      about ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {24} \right)$? And
      ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {18} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Predict what would happen if you applied the EncryptNumber
      algorithm to each of your three answers in the previous
      problem. Then try it out to test your prediction.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you use an algorithm to encode a message so that no
    strangers can understand it, it’s called an “encryption”
    algorithm. This is essentially what a computer does when you
    enter a password or other personal information on a website, so
    that nobody besides the website owner can see it.</p>

    <p>Another kind of encoding is called “compression”. With
    compression, the idea is to shrink the size of a message down
    so it’s faster to transport. This is why mp3’s are such a big
    deal: they allow you to compress very large song files so that
    they’re small enough to download quickly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Emmett wants to compress all the old emails he’s saved on
      his computer. Thinking of the shorthand he sometimes uses for
      text messages, he decides to go through each message and
      remove all the vowels and all the spaces. One problem with
      this approach is that it simply doesn’t shrink the message by
      all that much. However, there’s a much deeper problem. What
      is it? Can you suggest an alternative method for compressing
      Emmett’s emails?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What are some characteristics that would make a good
      compression algorithm? What characteristics are absolutely
      necessary?</p>

    <p>You saw with the compression and encryption algorithms above
      that they’re only useful if they also have <em>de</em>compression and
      <em>de</em>cryption algorithms to go with them. These are two examples
      of a more general type of algorithm called an <em class="vocab">inverse</em>
      algorithm. When you have two algorithms, and each one reverses
      the other, then the two algorithms are called <em class="vocab">inverses</em> of each
    other. Using this language, we can say the major flaw in
    Emmett’s compression algorithm was that it has no inverse
    algorithm. (Why not?)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are there certain initial

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Five pirates come across 100 bars of gold. The pirates
      have a pecking order, with #5 and #1 indicating the top and
      bottom-ranked pirates, respectively. Each pirate wants to
      maximize his or her share of the gold bars. There are no
      coalitions or
      collusions between them. They are all very analytical — they
        can think things through!</p>


      <p>Their process for splitting the loot is somewhat democratic.
      It begins with the top-ranked pirate making a proposal on how
      to divvy up the loot. (Note that the gold bars cannot be
      broken up, glued
      together, or otherwise changed; there are 100 bars of gold,
      period.) Each pirate
      gets one vote, up or down on the entire proposal. Remember,
      each pirate votes based on his or her own pocket and there
      are no side agreements of any sort. If the proposal gets 50%
      or more votes, it wins, and that’s that. On the other hand,
      if it fails to muster 50%, then the pirate who made the
      proposal is thrown overboard, and the process continues with
      the next pirate down the hierarchy.</p>

      <p>What is the maximum number of bars that the most powerful
      pirate can get and what allocation to each pirate will ensure
      him the 50% vote that he needs?</p>

Logarithms

<article>

  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The following tree diagrams, which are called <em class="vocab"> binary trees</em>,
    are all based on the same system for organizing
    information.</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Logarithms intro binary trees.png">
    </figure>
    
    <p>Each item (phone number, animal, letter) in the tree is
    called a “node”, and the nodes immediately below a node are
    called its “children”. As you can see, each node in the tree
    has at most two children. Furthermore, notice that as you start
    at the top and travel down the branches, every descendant down
    the right branch of a given node is somehow more than (or
    larger than, or after) that node, whereas every descendent to
    the left is somehow less.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s say we wanted to add the number “866-3162” to the
      phone number tree above. Even though it comes after
      “393-1765”, it would be wrong to hang it to the right of that
      number, because that would still be down the left branch from
      “555-1791”. Where should “866-3162” go? How about “squirrel”
      and “k” in their respective trees? There is only one correct
      answer for each of these.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Ask a group member to write down, without showing you, a
      list of 10 different numbers. Your group member will be
      reading the list to you one number at a time, and your job is
      to organize them into a binary search tree <em>as they’re being
        read to you</em>. There’s one rule: unlike in nature, these trees
      grow down. This means, for example, that the first number
      your group member reads will have to be the one at the very
      top of your tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Have your group member read the
      numbers to you, giving you time to add each number to the
      tree, without rearranging the ones you’ve added so far,
      before reading the next one out.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What would have happened if the
      numbers had been read to you in a different order? Try it and
      see.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In these small examples, it’s quite easy to see all the
    information at once, so they’re not necessarily any better than
    just writing out a simple list. Imagine, though, that instead
    of the 7 phone numbers in the first diagram, you had a binary
    tree with hundreds of phone numbers in it. (By the way, this is
    essentially how a cell phone really does store phone
    numbers.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Alice the ant starts at the top node of this large phone
      number tree and wants to know if the exterminator’s number,
      which she knows by heart, is in it. (She’s hoping it’s not!)
      Because Alice is so small, she can only read one node at a
      time, and she has to crawl down a branch to read another
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Describe a simple algorithm she can
      use to find out where the exterminator’s number would have to
      be, if it were in the tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Which of the following trees do you
      think Alice would rather search? Remember the old saying:
      when you’re trying to find something, it’s always in the last
      place you look!</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Trees.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>You saw from problem 2 that there is more than one possible
    “shape” that a binary tree can take, even with the same raw
    data.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each of the following, come up with a sequence of
      items, which, if you used your approach from problem 2, would
      end up in a binary tree with the given shape. (The items can
      be anything you want: names, numbers, etc.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> 
        <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image5.tif.jpg" >
        </figure>
      </p>
      
      <p class="problem-part">
          <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image6.tif.jpg" >
           </figure>
      </p>
      
      <p class="problem-part"> 
          <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image7.tif.jpg" >
           </figure>
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>The <em class="vocab">depth of a node</em> in a tree is the number of branches it
    is away from the top. So, for example, “chicken” in the animal
      tree has a depth of 2. The <em class="vocab">depth of the whole tree</em> is just the
    depth of its deepest node. (So the animal tree has a depth of
    3, because “mouse”, the deepest node, has a depth of 3.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Rearrange the lists of items you used in problem 4 so that
      the resulting trees have the minimum possible depth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Do the same for the list your group used in problem 2.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">The trees you made in problem 5 are examples of <em class="vocab">balanced</em>
    binary trees, whereas the one you made in problem 6 is not
    balanced. To see why, think of the tree like a hanging mobile:
    if each node is perfectly balanced, then the whole thing is
    balanced.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is it possible to arrange the numbers 1 through 7 into a
      balanced binary tree? How about 1 through 12? 1 through
      15?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A <em class="vocab">leaf</em> of a tree is a node that doesn’t have any children.
      Notice that in a balanced binary tree, all the leaves have
      the same depth. If a balanced binary tree has 512 leaves,
      then what is the depth of the tree?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Of course, not all trees have to be binary. If you
      continued
      the regular pattern of the tree below, how many leaves would
      the next level of the tree have? How deep would it need to be
      in order to have 4096 leaves?</p>

        <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image8.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>On some ancient computers, passwords had to consist of
      only the letters A through E. If I tell you that on these
      computers, there were 15625 passwords, and all of the
      passwords had to be the same length, can you say how many
      letters were required in a password?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the last three problems, you were effectively looking for
    exponents. You might have found yourself asking, in rather
    awkward English, the question:</p>

    <p>\[ \text{5 to the } what \ power \text{ equals 15625?} \]</p>
   
    <p>Fortunately, there’s a mathematical term for the number
      we’re looking for here: it’s called “the <em class="vocab">logarithm</em>, base 5, of
    15625”. Symbolically, it’s written <nobr>“${\log _5}\left( {15625}
      \right)$”.</nobr></p>

    <p class="new-page">So our awkward question is now both easier to pronounce:</p>

    <p>$$\rm{What \; is \; the \; log, base \; 5, of \; 15625?}$$</p>

    <p>and easier to write:</p>

    <p>$$\log_5 (15625)=x.$$</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Translate the equation above into an equation involving
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go back and set up problems 8-10 with equations using log
      notation. (No need to solve them again—just set them up.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use symbols to create a formal definition for what it
        means to say that <nobr>“$y$ is the log, base $b$, of $x$”.</nobr> Your
      definition should have the form:
        “(<em>equation involving</em> log) if and only if (<em>equation
      involving
        exponents</em>)”.</p>

<p>      This is something you can refer to whenever you need to
      translate to and from “log” notation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the following binary tree.</p>
   

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Logarithms leter tree.png" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">Assuming this tree was built
    similarly to the one you built in problem 2, what order could
    the letters have been added in?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What ordering would you use to
    produce a tree with the greatest possible depth?</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the depth of each of the trees described
      below.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A balanced binary tree that has
      1,048,576 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Every node that isn’t a leaf has 4
      children. There are 64 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Every non-leaf node has 6 children,
      and there are $X$ leaves. (Answer in terms of $X$, using log
      notation.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Unlike on this planet, primordial amoebas from Mars
      reproduce by splitting into three children. If life on Mars
      started with a single amoeba, but now there are 1,594,323
      amoebas, then:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate, without using a
      calculator, for how many
      amoeba-generations there has been life on Mars.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now rewrite the question as a
      logarithm, and find
      an exact answer (calculator allowed this time).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Translate the following awkward bits of English into log
      notation. (Notice that some are complete sentences, and
      others are fragments.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“What number could I raise 4 to, to
      get 64?”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The power of 3 that gives you
      81”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“4 to the <em>something-or-other</em> power
      equals 1024.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The number to which 6 must be
      raised in order to produce 216”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The number of times, starting with
        1, that you have to double to <nobr>get $x$”</nobr></p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Calculate the value of each of the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _3}\left( {81} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{13}}\left( {169}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _8}\left( {512} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{11}}\left( {14,641}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{100}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{1,000}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{10}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{15}}\left( {11,390,625}
      \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Start with $x = 243$. Check with your calculator that
      ${\log _3}\left( x \right) = 5$. How much do you have to add
      to $x$ to make ${\log _3}\left( x \right)$ go up by one? Up by
      two? Three?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since the number 3 is not one of the powers of 9, it’s not
    clear just what this question means, or how to find out what
    the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$ would be.
    Remember, though, that it’s also possible to have non-integer
    exponents. Let’s see if we can use that to find an answer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Start by rewriting ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right) = x$ in
      exponential form. Then, try tinkering with different ways to
      write this equation by applying some of your rules of
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You might have noticed in the problem above that it was much
    simpler to solve once you’d rewritten “3” as
    “${9^{{\raise0.5ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 1$}
    \kern-0.1em/\kern-0.15em \lower0.25ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle
    2$}}}}$”. In the next problem, try using a similar strategy:
    tinker with different ways of rewriting things, using the
    definition of logarithms and your exponent rules. (You might
    want to take a minute with your group to remind yourselves of
    all the rules.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the value of each of the following without using a
      calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _4}\left( {32} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _5}\left( {\frac{1}{{25}}}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{10}}\left( {0.000000001}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _7}\left( 1 \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why can you be sure that ${\log _2}\left( {42} \right)$ is
      not an integer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find every number from 1 to 1 million whose base-10
      logarithm is an integer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The “log” button on your calculator actually stands for
      “${\log _{10}}$”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Before trying it out, can you
      estimate roughly what ${\log _{10}}\left( {4000} \right)$ will be? Check it on the calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What are ${\log _{10}}\left( {40}
      \right)$, ${\log _{10}}\left( {40,000} \right)$, and ${\log
      _{10}}\left( 4 \right)$? What’s the pattern?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick several three-digit numbers, and use your calculator
      to find the base-10 log of each one. Now do the same with
      several four-, five-, and six-digit numbers. What do you
      notice?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _{10}}\left( 2 \right) = 0.301$, then what is
      the value of ${\log _{10}}\left( {2 \cdot {{10}^a}} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you want to see why your answer to the previous problem
    is true, try using
    the definition of log and your exponent rules to tinker with
    different ways of rewriting things, like you did earlier in
    problems 20-22. This will also help with the next two
    problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _2}\left( x \right) = 1.125$ and ${\log
      _2}\left( y \right) = 2.875$, then what is the value of
      ${\log _2}\left( {x \cdot y} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _4}\left( x \right) = 1.20$ and ${\log _4}\left(
      y \right) = 2.009$, then what is the value of ${\log
      _4}\left( {x \cdot y} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An ecologist is studying moose herds, to see if hunting
      practices are depleting the herds. In each herd, every year,
      $\frac{1}{3}$ of the population reproduces (1 baby moose
      each). Every fall, though, after the moose reproduce, hunters
      are allowed to hunt down 100 moose. In one herd, at the
      beginning of the study there are 270 moose. What would be the
      size of the herd population after 5 years? (Each year, round
      to the nearest moose.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>The situation above is an example of <em class="vocab">recursion</em> — a process
    in which the input at any particular stage depends on the
    output of a previous stage (or previous stages). In this
    particular case the size of the herd in any given year is
    dependent on its size the year before.</p>

    <p>If you understand exactly how the stages are related you can
    then express that relationship with an equation, called a
      <em class="vocab">recursive equation</em>. These equations
    will allow you to model and track changes in all sorts of
    populations — people, wildlife, bacteria, viruses, radioactive
    material and a host of others. People who use these powerful
    tools are interested in essentially three important questions:
    Will the population continue to increase without bound, will it
    level off at a
    certain number, or will it disappear after a certain
    period?</p>

    <p>Here is another example of a recursive process.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Enter any number greater than 1 in your calculator and
      find its square root. Then find the square root of your
      answer. Continue finding square roots of previous answers
      until something interesting develops. Do you think the same
      thing would happen with any number greater than 1 that you
      choose? How about any positive number less than 1?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A bacteria colony is placed into a Petri dish along with a
      bacteria-eating fungus. Every day, the bacteria population
      increases by 50%, but during the night at midnight, the
      fungus devours 50 bacteria.</p>

    <p>There are times when describing a set of data using
    recursive equations is the most efficient and times when it is
    the only thing you can do, but there are times when an explicit

    <div class="problem">
      <p>One of the simplest models for population growth is based
        on the idea that the <em>growth rate</em> of the population is
      proportional to the current size of the population. So, for
      example, we might expect that, each year, the number of frogs
      in a pond will increase by 6% every year.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write a recursive equation for this
      model of growth.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does this equation have any
      equilibria?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The population model you looked at in the previous problem
      has a major limitation: it doesn’t take into account the fact
      that the frogs in the pond have a limited number of resources
      (food, lily pad real estate, etc.). The following equation,
      called
      the logistic model of population growth,
      attempts to take this into account:</p>

      <p>${F_{n + 1}} = {F_n} + 1.1{F_n} \cdot \left( {\frac{{40 -
      {F_n}}}{{40}}} \right)$</p>

<p>      The idea here is that, the pond has a “carrying capacity” of
      40 frogs — i.e., it has enough resources for 40 frogs to live
      healthily. So, while the population’s growth rate is
      proportional to the current population size, it is also
      proportional to how close the population is to the carrying
      capacity.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Suppose that there were 15 frogs in
      the pond. According to the equation, how much would the
      population change the next year? How about if there were 35
      frogs in the pond?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does it seem plausible that this
      system (unlike the one in the previous problem) would have an
      equilibrium solution other than 0?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Starting with an initial population
      of 2 frogs, use the equation above to track the frog
      population over several years. What happens in the long
      run?</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Last year, you discovered that whenever you inscribed a
    triangle in a circle with one side being a diameter of the
    circle, the triangle seemed to be a right triangle. And some of
    you might have concluded, not without good reason, that
    this
    must always be the case. This kind of reasoning is called
    $inductive reasoning$— when you use a set of examples to claim
    a general theory.</p>

    <p>Most of you, however, may have remained unconvinced that
    this would be always the case, and set out to prove it using
    some of the axioms of geometry. The kind of reasoning you used
    is called $deductive reasoning$— the kind of reasoning
    preferred by mathematicians, and the kind which will be the
    focus of this lesson.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, inductive reasoning is often used to make a
    guess at a property by examining some cases, and deductive
    reasoning (deduction) to prove that the property generally
    holds.</p>

    <p>As in the case of the circle example above the conclusion
    reached by inductive reasoning proved to be indeed correct, but
    in many cases, conclusions reached by inductive reasoning will
    turn out to be false. If you check the value of the expression
    for the first 10 or so positive integer values of $n$, you
    might conclude that was a prime number for any positive integer
    $n$. It turns out that this is not the case.</p>

    <p>Can you find a value for n such that the expression is not a
    prime number?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Which of the following do you think might be an example of
      deductive reasoning? Inductive reasoning? “Reasoning” that is
      neither inductive nor deductive? Explain.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">All dogs are friendly.
      All friendly things are huggable.
      If something is huggable then it’s a cat.
      Therefore, all dogs are cats.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">All dogs are blue.
      All animals are blue.
      Therefore, all dogs are animals.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Every year since records were kept,
      if it rained in Cyber City on a particular day, it has rained
      three days later.
      It rained in Cyber City this past Monday.
      Therefore, it will rain in Cyber City this Thursday.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Whenever the weather is fine, Rose
      goes to the beach.
      Rose is now at the beach.
      So the weather must be fine.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this lesson not only will we explore logic problems
    including some similar to the ones in problem 1, but we will
    also introduce a different kind of geometry, called $finite
    geometry$. As its name suggests, finite geometry, unlike the
    geometry to which you are accustomed with an infinity of
    points, lines, planes, and so on, concerns itself solely with
    finite numbers of elements.</p>

    <p>We will study some of these geometries not only because of
    their quirky elegance but also because they provide a look into
    the nature of mathematical proof and help to sharpen your
    skills in developing valid logical arguments. They also show
    the power of visualization as an aid in solving more difficult
    problems.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>As you know from your work in Euclidean Geometry, any system
    of deductive reasoning consists of undefined terms,
    definitions, postulates (axioms), rules of logic (akin to
    common sense), and theorems (proved statements).</p>

    <p>Recall that a $postulate$($axiom)$ is a statement whose
    truth is to be accepted without proof, such as the line
    postulate in Euclidean Geometry, which states that one and only
    one line can be drawn through 2 distinct (different)
    points.</p>

    <p>And the truth of a $theorem$ is established by applying the
    rules of logic to the postulates. At each step in the proof of
    a theorem you must indicate which postulate you are applying,
    or which previously proved theorem you are drawing upon.</p>

    <p>Why must there be undefined terms? Is it possible to define
    every word/term? Try defining the color blue for a person who
    has no idea what blue is. And assume that if a person does not
    know what blue is, it is likely that the person will not know a
    host of other words associated with the color blue.</p>

    <p>But, of more importance, would the correctness of your
    reasoning be in
    question if some of the words used in the postulates were not
    defined? For example, supposed we replaced some of the words in
    problem 1a with words whose meanings you did not know, would
    you still conclude that it was a case
    of deductive reasoning?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is the following an example of deductive reasoning?
      Inductive reasoning? “Reasoning” that is neither inductive
      nor deductive?</p>

<p>      All blewters are sartoasted.
      All sartoasted things are ducated.
      If something is ducated then it’s an ook.
      Therefore, all blewters are ooks.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s try to draw a conclusion using all of the three
      postulates below.</p>

<p>      Postulate 1. No ooks are acks.
      Postulate 2. All kooks are ooks.
      Postulate 3. All pocks are acks.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw, if possible, a diagram
      satisfying all three postulates using exactly 3 ooks, 2 kooks
      and 4 acks.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Compare your answer to part a with
      others. How many ooks did you have that were not kooks? How
      many acks did you have that were not pocks?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In problem 3, is it correct to conclude that no kooks are
      pocks? Prove your answer.</p>
    </div>

    <p>There are a few different ways to solve problem 4. You might
    have used a kind of indirect argument, or, if you are more
    visually inclined, you might have used a Venn diagram, as
    suggested by problem 3.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s first look at an indirect argument.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">We’re eventually trying to prove
      that no kooks are pocks,
      but to start out, suppose that the opposite were true. That
      is, suppose there is some kook that is also a pock. Using
      Postulate 3, what conclusion can you draw about that
      kook?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using your answer to part a, and
      Postulate 1, what new
      conclusion can you draw about our kook?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now use Postulate 2 to complete
      your argument.</p>
    </div>

    <p>This kind of argument you used in problem 5 is called $proof
    by contradiction.$ Here is how it works. First, assume that the original statement
    you want to
    prove is false. Second, by reasoning from this assumption,
    reach a conclusion that is impossible — impossible, either
    because it contradicts a postulate or an established theorem,
    or because it contradicts the given information. Third, since
    assuming your original statement was false led to
    contradictions of known facts, you can now conclude that the
    original statement must instead be true.</p>

    <p>This kind of argument, proof by contradiction, makes use of
    a very important fact in the rules of logic — that any
    statement is equivalent to (exactly the same as) its
    $contrapositive$. Some of you may have encountered this term
    before. Here’s an example of a statement and its
    contrapositive.</p>

    <p>Statement: To be selected for Eightnotes you have to be a
    singing sensation.</p>

    <p>Contrapositive: If you are not a singing sensation, then you
    will not be selected to Eightnotes. [or you can kiss Eightnotes
    goodbye.]</p>

    <p>Here’s another:</p>

    <p>Statement: If an animal is a zebra, then it has stripes.</p>

    <p>Contrapositive: If an animal does not have stripes, then it
    is not a zebra.</p>

    <p>Would you agree that in the example above the statement and
    its contrapositive are equivalent? What follows is a somewhat
    less subtle use of the contrapositive. In the problem, x is
    considered to be an integer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If x is not equal to 3, then ${x^3}$ is not equal to
      27.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write the contrapositive of the
      above statement.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is it easier to prove the statement
      directly, or to prove its contrapositive?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Back to problem 4. For a more visual approach, you might
    have represented each postulate by a Venn diagram (see below)
    and used the final picture to reach your conclusion.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/image4.tif.jpg" >
      $Postulate 1
      $</figure>

    <figure>

      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/image51.tif.jpg" >
      $Postulate 2$<img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/image61.tif.jpg" >
      $Postulate 3$</figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw Venn diagrams for the postulates in problems 1a and
      1b, and use them to check the answers you gave earlier.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Next we will take a look at some finite geometries. But
    before we explore a more traditional example with “points”,
    “lines”, etc., let’s look at one that might be a tad more
    familiar.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Postulate 1. There are six people and four
      entrees.&nbsp;
      Postulate 2. Everyone is sharing at least one entree with at
      least one other person.&nbsp;
      Postulate 3. Everyone is eating.&nbsp;</p>

      <p>Draw out two different actual dinners that satisfy the
      postulates.&nbsp; In your diagrams you may use anything you
      please to represent people and entrees, but you have no
      choice regarding six and four.</p>

<p>      The diagrams you drew are called $models$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here is a more traditional one with three postulates. The
    terms “lines” and “points” are undefined and you must resist
    the temptation to think of these
    elements the way you did in Euclidean Geometry. For example, in
    a finite
    geometry a “line” cannot contain an infinite number of “points”
    since there
    are only a finite number of “points” in these geometries.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Postulate 1. There are 5 points and 5 lines.
      Postulate 2. Every line contains at least 2 points.
      Postulate 3. Every point is on at least one line.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Check that the following diagram
      represents the set of
      postulates — that, in fact, it is a model.
      </p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/diagram%209a.tif.jpg" >

    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">The following is also a model for the
    system, but is
    essentially the same as the one above. Why does this claim make
    sense? (Think back to your graph theory lesson.)</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-4-logic-and-finite-geometry/diagram%209b.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>On a soccer team, 5 students are vying for 5 spots. The
      coach wants to make sure that there are at least 2 players
      for each position, and that each player gets to play in at
      least one position. Draw a model for this system.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the postulates and models of problem 9, one group of
      students concluded that every point must be on at most two
      lines. Draw a model different from those in problem 7 to
      refute that claim.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Although models are extremely helpful in creating and
    examining conjectures, you have to be careful not to rely on
    models to construct proofs. In a very few cases it might be
    possible to construct every possible model satisfying all the
    postulates, but in general that would be very difficult to do.
    And even if you could construct all possible models, it might
    still be difficult to prove that you have done so. So to prove
    conclusions, you should reason directly from the
    postulates.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Based on your models in problems 9 and 11, make a claim,
      then try to refute it by drawing yet another model satisfying
      all the postulates of problem 9.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the following geometry with four postulates, lines and
      points are undefined.</p>

<p>      Postulate 1. There exist exactly 3 points.
      Postulate 2. Given any 2 points, there is exactly one line on
      them.
      Postulate 3. Not all points are on the same line.
      Postulate 4. Given any 2 lines, they are on at least one
      common point.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw a model.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that 2 different lines cannot
      have more than one
      point in common. (You may use postulate 2 and proof by
      contradiction.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can there be 4 lines?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that not all lines have the
      same point in common.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are there parallel lines in this
      system? (In finite geometries, two lines are $parallel$ if
      they do not share a common point.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Before working in any deductive system it is important to
    examine the postulates for $consistency$— is it possible for
    all the postulates to be true at the same time? The rule of
    thumb is that if you can draw a diagram to represent the set of
    postulates, then the postulates are consistent. Can you come up
    with some reasonable argument why drawing a diagram would allow
    the claim that the
    postulates are consistent? The systems in problems 8 and 9
    passed the test since we were able to construct a model for
    each.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Check the following system for consistency. Lines and
      points are undefined terms.</p>

<p>      Postulate 1. There are 4 points and 5 lines.
      Postulate 2. Every line contains exactly 2 points.
      Postulate 3. Every point is on exactly 2 lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s now create a finite geometry that seems less
      abstract than the previous two.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Replace undefined terms “points”
      and “lines” in problem 13 by new undefined terms “students”
      and “committees” respectively, and rewrite the four
      postulates, changing the language a bit to make sense with
      the new terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw a chart of students and
      committees that would
      represent the postulates. (Your chart should have 3 rows
      for the 3 students, and as many columns for committees
      as you wish.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are your postulates in part a
      consistent?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many committees did you finally
      end up with?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is there a student who is on all
      committees?</p>

      Postulate 3. Given any two lines, there is at least one point
      that is contained in both lines.
      Postulate 4. Given any line, there are at least three points
      that are contained in the line.
      Postulate 5. Given any line, there is at least one point that
      is not on the line.
      Postulate 6. There is at least one line.</p>

      <p>As we did in problem 15, let’s make
      problem 30 a little less abstract.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Replace undefined terms “points”
      and “lines” by new undefined terms (you use “students” and
      “committees” again if you like), and rewrite the postulates,
      changing the language a bit to accommodate the new terms.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw a chart that would represent
      the postulates. How many “points” did you end up with? How
      many “lines”?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Would the addition of another
      “point” or “line” violate any of the postulates?</p>

      others. However to show that a system is independent, one
      must show that no one axiom follows from the others.</p>

      <p>This curriculum was written by members (past and present) of the upper 
school math department at the Park School of Baltimore. This was possible 
thanks to Park School’s F. Parvin Sharpless Faculty and Curricular 
Advancement (FACA) program, which supports faculty every summer in major 
curricular projects. In addition to the support of FACA by the Nathan L. 
Cohen Faculty Enhancement fund and the Joseph Meyerhoff FACA fund, this 
project was also funded by grants from the E. E. Ford Foundation, the 
Benedict Foundation, Josh and Genine Fidler, and an anonymous donor.</p>

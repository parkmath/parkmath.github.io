    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>You have already seen how coordinate geometry works, with
    the focus on slope and distance. Now you will be considering an
    earlier geometry, where there
    are no coordinates, so lines don’t have particular slopes, nor
    do we determine numerical distances between points. It’s just
    our reasoning and imagination that enable us to discover
    valuable relationships among the figures we draw.</p>

    <p>In this lesson, you will start to use this reasoning and
    imagination to help uncover
    the structure of geometry. Some things you know about geometry
    are simple and you may be happy to take them on faith. Others
    are less obvious, but can be explained by a careful argument.
    Still others may remain mysterious for now.</p>

    <p>To give you some tools, let’s start with the figure below,
    which you have probably seen in various contexts. The figure
    shows parallel lines a and b and line t crossing
    them. The line t is called a transversal, as it “moves” across
    the other pair
    of lines.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/parallel%20lines%20and%20transvers.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the figure above, label all the acute angles you
      believe to be equal in measure with the letter $x$. Then
      label all the obtuse angles you believe to be equal in
      measure with the letter $y$. Are there any angles that you
      haven’t labeled?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the relationship between the value of $x$ and the
      value of $y$? Make an argument that doesn’t depend on knowing
      the specific value of $x$ or of $y$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Some of these pairs of angles come up often enough so as to
    deserve special mention. In the diagram below angles
      1 and 3 are <strong>corresponding angles</strong>. Angles 3 and 7 are <strong>alternate
      interior angles</strong>. Angles 2 and 3 are
      <strong>same-side interior angles</strong>. Notice that lines $l$ and $m$ need
    not be parallel,
    yet the names still apply.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/non-parallel%20lines%20and%20trans.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Name another pair of angles in the above figure that
      are</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Corresponding.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Alternate interior.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Same-side interior.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the figure showing lines $l$ and $m$ not parallel, you’ll
      notice
      that there are no longer so many pairs of equal angles. But
      there is a fact that carries over from the previous figure.
      What is it, and how do you know for sure?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you have two parallel lines crossed by a transversal,
      do you think that the pairs of corresponding angles will
      always be equal? How about the pairs of alternate interior
      angles? Try to find an exception.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw another two parallel lines crossed by a transversal.
      The same-side interior angles probably don’t look equal. Is
      there anything else you can say about them? If you’re not
      sure, take some measurements.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>The results you found/reviewed in the introduction are basic
    results in geometry. You may have learned them before, and you
    may consider them so obvious that you wonder why anyone would
    point them out. The reason is that we can use those simple
    facts to convince ourselves of some results that are not so
    simple!</p>

    <p>For instance, you have probably been raised to believe that
    there are 180 degrees in a triangle, even though that fact is
    not visually obvious. But the few results we’ve stated so far
    in this chapter can serve to convince us once and for all.</p>

    <p>Below is a triangle, meant to be general enough to stand for
    any triangle. It would be nice to use some of your findings so
    far to prove that the sum of its angles is 180 degrees.
    However, there are no parallel lines in this picture, so there
    doesn’t appear to be much we can do.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/Triangle%20ABC.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Add something to the diagram so that you do have some
      parallel lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now that you have some parallel lines, label as many
      angles as you can that you know to be equal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now finish the proof that the angles of a triangle add up
      to 180 degrees.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You have probably known for a long time that the angles of a
    triangle add up to 180 degrees — in that sense, you did not
    learn any new facts by doing this proof. However, you may not
    have realized how strongly the result depends on alternate
    interior angles (or whichever angle pair you decided to use)
    being equal when lines are parallel. In fact, there are
    non-Euclidean geometries in which the alternate
    interior result is not true, where the alternate interior
    angles result is not true — and, sure enough, in those
    geometries, the angles of a triangle can actually add up to
    more or less than 180 degrees!</p>

    <p class="new-page">The ancient Greeks appreciated how important it was to
    uncover the structure of geometry, and very often looked for
    proofs of statements they were pretty sure were true using
    statements they already knew to be true. They tried to reduce
    the number of statements they accepted without proof to the
    smallest number possible. The most famous Greek geometer,
    Euclid, was able to reduce his number of assumptions to five
    mathematical statements and five “common notions” — like “two
    things equal to the same thing are equal to each other.” He was
    able to prove a huge amount of geometry from these simple
    assumptions.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the spirit of Euclid, try to prove that angles 1 and
      3
      below are equal. What facts are you relying on?</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/Vertical%20angles.svg" >
    </figure>
    </div>
    
    <p>The rest of this Development consists of examples of some
    other argument styles that do not involve coordinates.</p>

    <p class="new-page">Another fact you have known for a long time is that the area
    of a triangle can
    be found by the formula $\text{Area } = \frac12 \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}$.
    You might also have seen the following picture, designed to
    show why the formula is true for right triangles.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/right triangle in rectangle replacement.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>But alas, not all triangles are right, and we’d still like
    to be able to use this familiar formula with any triangle. So
    below is triangle $ANY$.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-1-parallel-lines-and-first-principles/Triangle%20ANY.svg" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Add something to the diagram so that you can use what
      you know about the area of rectangles and right triangles
      to find its area. Is your formula equivalent to $\text{Area } = \frac12 \cdot \text{base} \cdot \text{height}$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>And last, but not least, a Physical Challenge:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Using only a compass and a tool for
      drawing straight lines, construct an equilateral triangle.
      Your tool for drawing straight lines may not be a ruler, or
      anything else that can take measurements.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Come up with an argument that would
      convince a friend that the triangle you constructed really
      has to be equilateral and, if they did the same thing, their
      triangle would be
      equilateral, too.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Given that $\overline {AB} $ is parallel to $\overline
      {CD} $, which pairs of angles must be equal?</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">

    </div>      

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the figure below, ABCD and PBQD are parallelograms.
      Which of the numbered angles must be the same size as the
      angle numbered 1?

    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Given the following figure, where only the horizontal
      segments are parallel, name three angle pairs that are equal
      and three angle pairs you can conclude are <em class="vocab">supplementary:

      <p>Assuming that alternate interior angles are equal when

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In problem 11, triangle $ANY$ was meant to stand for any
      triangle, but notice that triangle ANY was drawn to be acute.

    There are a number of other two-dimensional forms that we can

    intersecting
    the triangle. Now erase what’s above $\overline {BC} $.
    You’re
    looking at what is called a trapezoid — a four-sided figure
    with one pair of parallel sides.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p><em>C’est Mathematique!</em> is a French expression meaning that
    something is so certain, it is definite. Indeed, the
    19th-Century French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace imagined
    a demon that could predict every future event because it knew
    the exact position of every particle in the universe, and the
    mathematical laws that governed the motion of those
    particles.</p>

    <p>Though no such demon exists, we can see why Laplace might
    have imagined one. Our mathematical knowledge does seem more
    certain than some other facts we believe to be true about
    politics or human nature. For instance, maybe you think that
    passing laws to ban handguns will reduce homicides. Then you
    read a study that says that actually these bans don’t have that
    effect. You might change your mind about whether banning
    handguns is a good idea… until you read another study that says
      that the bans <em>do</em> reduce accidental death among children.
    You’ll always have to remain open to changing your opinion
    based on new information.</p>

    <p>Likewise, in the history of science, people once thought
    that the atom was the smallest particle that existed (the word
    “atom” comes from a Greek word
    meaning “indivisible”). Now we know that atoms are made up of
    protons and neutrons, and in recent decades scientists have
    discovered quarks. In the scientific community, people are
    constantly revising and improving accepted theories.</p>

    <p>In mathematics, on the other hand, we still accept the
    results of ancient texts. Archimedes, Pythagoras, and Euclid
    are credited with many of the results that we still use today.
      You have probably already <em class="vocab">proven</em> things mathematically in such
    a way that you’re sure they must be true. In this lesson we’ll
    look at what it means for a proof to be absolutely airtight —
    with no possibility you’ll want to revise your opinion
    later.</p>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s think about the following two statements:</p>

    <p><em>The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.</em></p>
    <p><em>The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect the angles from which
      they’re drawn.</em></p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make some sketches to determine whether you think each of
      these statements is true or false. Recall that “bisect” means
      “cut exactly in half.”</p>
    </div>

    <p>When we do proofs in this section, we’re going to focus on
    making them airtight. We’ll use the following standard. Any
    time we make a statement as part of a proof, we need to be able
    to give a reason for that statement. That reason, in turn,
    needs to be a statement about geometry that we $already$ know
    to be true.</p>

    <p>Here are some statements about geometry you already know to
    be true:</p>

    <ul style="margin-left: 21%; width: 79%;">
    <li>In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the congruent
    sides are
      congruent.<br><br></li>

   <li>When parallel lines are cut by a transversal, same-side
    interior angles
     add up to 180 degrees.<br><br></li>

    <li>Vertical angles are equal.<br><br></li>

    <li>If two sides and the angle between them in one triangle are
    congruent to two sides and the angle between them in another
    triangle, then the triangles are congruent. (SAS congruence
      theorem)<br><br></li>
    <li>If the three sides of one triangle are all related to the sides
    of another
    triangle by the same proportion, then the triangles are
    similar.
    (SSS similarity theorem)<br><br></li>

<li>    In a parallelogram, opposite sides are congruent.<br><br></li>
                </ul>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Make a list of statements about geometry that you know to
      be true, including the six statements above. To get ideas,
      try paging through your notes from the past few weeks, or
      through the lessons earlier in this textbook. Which results
      seem worth remembering? Also think about some basic shapes
      you know, like quadrilaterals, and write down some facts you
      know to be true about each one.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As you may recall from the first lesson of this chapter, the
    Greek mathematician Euclid did something very similar to what
    you are about to do. He boiled down his geometric knowledge to
    a few assumptions and then proved the rest of what he knew
    about geometry using those few things. He called the facts he
    assumed without proof “postulates.” Any fact that he had proved
    was a “theorem.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consolidate the list you made in the previous problem with
      the rest of the class. Discuss which items on it are
      postulates
      and which are theorems. Now separate a blank page of your
      notebook into two columns. Label one column “postulates” and
      the other “theorems.” Write the items in the class list
      in
      the appropriate column. Leave yourself lots of room in both
      columns to add to the list, probably over multiple pages.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Hang on to this list. You’ll be referring to it for the
    remainder of this chapter.</p>

    <p>Now let’s return to the problem of proving the statements
    from the beginning of this lesson. If you did your job
    carefully, you’ll have found that the first
    statement was true — the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect
    each other.</p>

    <p>Before writing our airtight proof of this fact, it’s
    important to know where to start. Since we’re proving something
    about a parallelogram, it’s all right to assume that we $have$ a parallelogram. So let’s draw one…</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/replacement parallelogram development.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>… and label the vertices so that we can talk about them
    later. So, specifically, $\overline {AD} \parallel \overline
    {BC} $ and $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {DC} $. Those
    are two things we know for sure. It’s also important to be sure
    of what we want to show about this diagram. Let’s draw in some
    diagonals and call their intersection point $E$.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/parallelogram%202.svg" >
    </figure>

    <p>Then what we want to show is that $\overline {AE} \cong
    \overline {EC} $ and $\overline {BE} \cong \overline {ED} $.</p>

    <p>The comic book hero G.I. Joe used to say “knowing is half
    the battle.” In the case of proof, knowing what information you
    have to start with and where you want to end up with is half
    the battle. Really!</p>

    <p>What we need now is a chain of reasoning, beginning with the
    facts that $\overline {AD} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \left\|
    {{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \overline {BC} } \right.$ and
    $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {DC} $ and ending with the
    statement that $\overline {AE} \cong \overline {EC} $ and
    $\overline {BE} \cong \overline {ED} $. In this chain of
    reasoning, every step needs to be justified with
      some reason we <em>know for sure</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Try this yourself before reading the proof on the next
      page.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When thinking about what will help us to write this proof,
    let’s think backwards a little bit. We want to show that
    certain lengths are the same. Look back at your list of
    postulates. What tools do you have for showing that lengths are
    the same? Not the results about parallel lines. Not vertical
    angles or linear pairs. Possibly some statements you have about
    parallelograms or rhombuses, but in this case the lengths we’re
    interested in are diagonals rather than sides of those shapes.
    That really only leaves one thing that could help — congruent
    triangles.</p>

    <p>If we can show that certain triangles are congruent, then we
    can conclude that the lengths making them up are also
    congruent. That should be our strategy in writing this
    proof.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find some congruent triangles in this diagram that you
      think would help. Do you know for sure they’re congruent?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Depending on the way you answered question #5, you may have
    an airtight proof already. Let’s write one out as an example of
    a chain of reasoning in which all the steps are justified.</p>

    </ul>

    <p>
    Are we done? YES! We’ve accomplished our goal, showing that the
    diagonals cut each other in half.</p>

    <p>That proof might have been written with a little more care
    than you are used to. Your class will have to decide exactly
    how much writing is expected in a proof. But notice that every
    step in the argument comes from your list of postulates, so
    that anyone who accepts the postulates can't disagree with your
    conclusion — there is no “wiggle room” in this proof.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, you should have found that it is <em>not</em> true that
    the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect the angles. You may
    remember from last year that an example designed to show that
      something isn’t true is called a <strong>counterexample</strong>. Here’s what a
    counterexample to this statement might look like:</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/5 diagram.tif.jpg">
    </figure>

    <p>You can see from this picture that it doesn’t look true that
    the angles are bisected, and so it isn’t worth your time to
    look for a proof.</p>

    <p>In order to start the proof that the diagonals of a
    parallelogram bisect each other, we had to know exactly what
    the word “parallelogram” meant. That’s how we knew to start
    with the statements “$\overline {AB} {\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
    \left\| {{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt} \overline {CD} } \right.$ and
    $\overline {AD} \parallel \overline {BC} $”. Whenever we write
    a proof, we’ll have to be very precise about what we mean by
    the objects we’re talking about. For instance, last year you
    worked with the definition of a square: a quadrilateral with
    four congruent sides and four right angles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a definition for each shape. Then compare
      notes with your class if you haven’t already done so.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now begin a section in your notebook labeled
      “definitions,” again leaving space for you to add definitions

    <h2>Going Further:
    Longer Proofs; Pitfalls When Writing Proofs</h2>

    <p>Sometimes the only way you can see that a statement must be
    true is to talk yourself through a series of steps in
    proof-like form. It would be hard to come to know the statement
    to be proven below, in any other way. In addition, the
    statement’s proof deals with some complications that you will
    sometimes come across.</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/demo proof replacement.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>Given: $\overline {XQ} {\kern 1pt} \cong \overline {XU} $ and$\angle XQY \cong \angle XUZ$.<br>
    Prove:$\angle UZY \cong \angle QYZ$.</p>

    <p>“<em class="vocab">Working backwards and forwards”</em> will be very important in
    the planning stages of this proof. At first glance, it seems
    that we should try to prove triangles $QYZ$ and $UZY$ congruent, since those are the triangles that contain the two
    angles we want to prove congruent.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find as much evidence as you can that $\triangle QYZ \cong \triangle UZY$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the previous problem you should have found a (shared)
    side and an angle, which by themselves are not enough to prove
    the triangles congruent. So we need to find another strategy.
    It may be that, using some other pair of congruent triangles in
    the figure, we can find that third piece of information
    needed
    to prove $\triangle QYZ \cong \triangle UZY$. Or, perhaps the solution is something completely
    different. Instead of doing all of our planning backwards,
    let’s return to thinking forwards and just look for any pair of
    triangles that might be congruent.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Name some other pairs of triangles that might be congruent
      in the figure. Try to find enough evidence for their
      congruence.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The triangles that we can actually prove congruent may have
    been hard to spot. As a hint, they share angle $X$. If you
    haven’t already, prove that these two
    triangles are congruent.</p>

    <p>Now that we have congruent triangles, we can mark all of
    their sides and angles congruent, as follows:</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-3-geometric-proof/demo proof prettier continuation.png" >
    </figure>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now we can return to the question of how to prove$\angle
      UZY \cong \angle QYZ$. Using the information we’ve derived,
      argue that these angles are congruent.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One way to complete the proof is to notice that, since we
    now know $\triangle XYZ$
    is isosceles, $\angle XZY \cong \angle XYZ$. Since these
    angles are both composed of two parts, and the parts $\angle
    XZU$ and$\angle XYQ$ are congruent to each other, that means
    the remaining parts must be equal as well. In other words,
    $\angle UZY \cong \angle QYZ$! Though this kind of
    part/whole reasoning doesn’t appeal to theorems or
    postulates that are most likely on your list, it is a common
    type of geometrical reasoning. Your class can decide what kind
    of language it wants to use for these types of arguments.</p>

    <p>After all that, we have used congruent triangles to figure
    out why $\angle UZY \cong \angle QYZ$. However, much of the
    argument was probably done
    orally, in combination with a marked-up diagram. It is now time
    to</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write a formal proof of the fact that $\angle UZY \cong
      \angle QYZ$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the proof you just wrote, you took pains to make sure
    that each statement was correctly justified. However, it is
    easy to be sloppy when writing proofs. Two examples of proofs
    follow that illustrate some mistakes that are easy to make.</p>

    <p>Consider the proof below showing that, if a quadrilateral
    has two pairs of
    congruent, opposite angles, then the quadrilateral is a
    parallelogram.</p>
    
<ul style="margin-left: 21%; width: 79%;">
    <li>First, draw a quadrilateral that can stand for any
    quadrilateral with
    congruent, opposite angles. Label the vertices $ABCD$, where
    $\angle A \cong \angle C$ and $\angle B \cong \angle D$.<br><br></li>

    <li>Given: Quadrilateral ABCD, $\angle A \cong \angle C$,
    $\angle B \cong \angle D$.<br><br></li>

    <li>Prove: $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {CD} $, $\overline {BC} \parallel \overline {AD} $.<br><br></li>

    <li>Draw the diagonal $\overline {AC} $.<br><br></li>

<li>    $\angle B \cong \angle D$, as given.<br><br></li>

    <li>$\overline {AB} \cong \overline {CD} $ and $\overline
    {BC} \cong \overline {AD} $, because opposite sides of a
    parallelogram are congruent.<br><br></li>

    <li>Therefore, $\triangle ABC \cong \triangle CDA$ by the SAS congruence theorem.<br><br></li>

    <li>Then $\angle DAC \cong \angle BCA$ since they are
    corresponding parts of congruent triangles.<br><br></li>

    <li>That makes $\overline {BC} \parallel \overline {AD} $ since alternate interior angles are
    congruent.<br><br></li>

    <li>Similarly, $\angle BAC \cong \angle DCA$, again since
    they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles.<br><br></li>

    <li>So $\overline {AB} \parallel \overline {CD} $.<br><br></li>

    <li>Therefore, $ABCD$ is a parallelogram.<br><br></li>
    </ul>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>This proof may seem to work quite well. However, it
      contains a major error that invalidates the proof entirely.
      What is this error?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>This type of error is sometimes called <em class=vocab>circular reasoning</em>. Why do you suppose this phrase is used?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Do you still think it’s true that, if a quadrilateral has
      two pairs of congruent, opposite angles, it must be a
      parallelogram?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Finally, here is an example of a proof that just can’t be
    right: if a triangle is
    isosceles, then it must be equilateral. You have seen lots of
    isosceles triangles
    that are not equilateral, so you know that this proof must
    contain a mistake! The challenge is to find out what that
    mistake is. Remember that, if you agree with every step of a
    proof, you have no choice but to accept its conclusion.</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 21%; width: 79%;">    
  <li>Given: $\triangle ABC$ with $\overline {AB} \cong \overline {AC} $.<br><br></li>

    <li>Prove: $\overline {AC} \cong \overline {BC} $ (which would
    also make $\overline {AC}$ congruent to $\overline {AB} $).<br><br></li>

    <li>Draw the median from $C$ and label the point where it hits
    $\overline {AB} $ as $D$.<br><br></li>

    <li>$\overline {AD} \cong \overline {DB} $ because $\overline
    {CD} $ is a median.<br><br></li>

    <li>Also, $\angle CDA \cong \angle CDB$ because, as a median,
    $\overline {CD} $ splits $\overline {AB} $ into two right
    angles.<br><br></li>

    <li>$\overline {CD} \cong \overline {CD} $ because any line
    segment is congruent to itself.<br><br></li>

    <li>Therefore, by SAS congruence, $\triangle CAD \cong \triangle CBD$.<br><br></li>

    <li>Since they are corresponding parts of congruent triangles,
    $\overline {AC} \cong \overline {BC} $.<br><br></li>

    <li>Therefore, all three sides of $\triangle ABC$ are congruent, making it
    equilateral.</li>

        parallelogram.<br><br>

      Proof: Draw segments $\overline {AB} $ and $\overline {CD}
      $ so as to be congruent and parallel. Connect points A and
      C. Then connect points B and D. Because $\overline {AB} $ and $\overline {CD} $ are congruent and parallel,
      the line segments $\overline {AC} $ and $\overline {BD} $ have to slope in the
      same direction. Therefore, $\overline{AC} \parallel \overline{BD}$, and so ABCD is a
      parallelogram.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that the diagonals of a

      Proof: We’ve already proven, and put on our theorem list,
      that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. A
      rhombus is a type of parallelogram. Therefore, any
      statement
      that applies to a parallelogram also applies to a rhombus,
      and so the diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Prove that the diagonals of a
      parallelogram bisect each other. (We’ve already proved this,
      but here is an alternate version of a proof.)<br><br>

      Proof: Draw parallelogram $ABCD$, and add diagonals that
      cross at E. We’re going to show that triangles $AED$ and
      $CEB$ are congruent. The two pairs of angles needed for
      congruence are $\angle DAE \cong \angle ACB$ and $\angle
      ADB \cong \angle DBC$.
      Those pairs really are congruent because they are both pairs
      of alternate interior angles created by parallel lines and a
      transversal. Also, sides $\overline {AD} $ and $\overline

      bisect each other: $\overline {DE} \cong \overline {EB} $ and $\overline {AE} \cong \overline {EC} $ as they are

  <h2>Problems</h2>
    <div class="problem">
      <p>At the beginning of a lesson, you found that the diagonals
      of a parallelogram do not always bisect the angles from which
      they are drawn. How about for a rhombus? Prove it or find a
      counterexample.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For which of the following shapes — square, rectangle,
      parallelogram, trapezoid, kite, rhombus — are the diagonals
      always perpendicular to each other? Investigate with
      sketches.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For the shapes in the previous problem where the answer is
      “yes,” prove your response. Before beginning each proof,
      carefully state the given and what is to be proved. Hint: how
      can you possibly show that an angle is 90 degrees if you
      don’t know the measures of any other angles in the
      figure?</p>

Lesson 4:


Logic And Geometry 
</h1>
          
          
          

<article>

  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Lewis Carroll, of <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> fame, made the
    following set of statements in his less famous book, <em>Symbolic
      Logic</em>.”</p>

    <p>No potatoes of mine, that are new, have been boiled.
    All my potatoes in this dish are fit to eat.
    No unboiled potatoes of mine are fit to eat.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What, if anything, can you conclude from these three
      statements?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>It’s a well-known fact that all squares are rectangles, but
    not all rectangles are squares. We can express these statements
    in the form below.</p>

    <div style="margin: 3em;"><p>If a figure is a square, then it is a rectangle. (true)<br>
      If a figure is a rectangle, then it is a square. (false)</p></div>

    <p>You may recall that these statements are called <em class="vocab">converses</em> of
    each other, as is true of any pair of statements of the
    form</p>

    <div style="margin: 3em;"><p>If $A$ then $B$.<br>
      If $B$ then $A$.</p></div>

    <p>You may have seen Venn diagrams at some point in your life.
    They are handy when thinking about logic. For instance, the
    statement “All business people are savvy” (or “If a person is a
    businessman, then he is savvy”) can be represented by the
    following diagram:</p>

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/06-4-logic-and-geometry/logic%20diagrams.png" >
    </figure>

    <p>In this example, Algernon is a savvy businessman, Aberforce
    is savvy but not a businessman, and Aloysius is neither savvy
    nor a businessman.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Draw a similar diagram illustrating the statement “All
      savvy people are businessmen.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you write the statement
      in “if/then” form?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Do the diagrams make it clear that
      the statements “All businessmen are savvy” and “All savvy
      people are businessmen” mean different things?</p>
    </div>

    <p>You’ve seen that if/then statements have converses, and that
    just because the if/then statement is true doesn’t necessarily
    mean the converse is. Here are two other types of statements
    you can get from an if/then statement.</p>

    <p>Take the statement “if $A$ then $B$”.<br>
      “If not-$A$ then not-$B$” is called the <em class="vocab">inverse</em>.<br>
      “If not-$B$ then not-$A$” is called the <em class="vocab">contrapositive</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick three “test” statements of the form “if $A$ then $B$.”
      Then use them to decide if the inverse and/or the
      contrapositive must be true when the original statement is.
      If you’re not sure, try drawing Venn diagrams.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Some statements on your list of theorems and postulates can
    be written in if/then form as well, and it is worth
    investigating if their converses are true. For example, you
    probably have the following statement:</p>

    <p>Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write a pair of if/then statements expressing this
      statement and its converse.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If you were going to prove the converse, what would be the
      given? What would be the result that you are trying to
      prove?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go ahead and prove the statement “if a quadrilateral has
      both pairs of opposite sides congruent, then it is a
      parallelogram.” (Hint: this is a problem where adding
      something extra to the diagram is useful.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>Another way of saying what you just proved is that having
      both pairs of opposite sides congruent is <em class="vocab">sufficient</em> for a
    quadrilateral to be a parallelogram. In other words, if you
    have a quadrilateral and you know its opposite sides are
    congruent, that’s enough — you don’t need to know anything else
    about it to know that it’s a parallelogram.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the original statement on your list,
    “Opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent,” provides a
    statement that is true about all parallelograms. This kind of
      statement is called a <em class="vocab">necessary</em> condition. For if you’ve got
    a quadrilateral without congruent opposite sides, you know you
    definitely don’t have a parallelogram. You’re lacking one of
    the necessary criteria.</p>

    <p>Conditions aren’t always both necessary and sufficient. For
    example, having four right angles is necessary for a
    quadrilateral to be a square, but having four right angles is
    not sufficient for a quadrilateral to be a square. The
    quadrilateral might be only a rectangle and still have four
    right angles.</p>

    <p>Also, conditions can be sufficient without being necessary.
    For example, a closed shape’s having three 60-degree angles is
    sufficient for the shape to be a triangle, but it is certainly
    not necessary that a triangle have three 60-degree angles.</p>

    <p>What’s more, necessary and sufficient conditions don’t have
    to be about shapes. For example, at Park, playing soccer for
    all four years is sufficient to fill your athletic requirement.
    Also, being a senior is necessary for taking Senior Studio —
    you can’t take Senior Studio without being a senior.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is having four congruent sides necessary, sufficient, or
      both for being a square?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is having four congruent sides necessary, sufficient, or
      both for being a rhombus?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is playing soccer all four years a necessary condition for
      Park students to satisfy their athletic requirement? Is being
      a senior at Park sufficient for taking Senior Studio?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Poet Li-Young Lee says “every wise child is a sad child.”
      According to him, is being a wise child sufficient for being
      a sad child?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is being seventeen sufficient for having a provisional
      driver’s license in Maryland?</p>

      eight?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is being a pair of numbers’ LCM…</p>

      <p class="problem-part">…sufficient for being divisible by

      each of those numbers?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is being divisible by 108 a sufficient condition for a

    <p>Many arguments have this type of structure:</p>

    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>If a Park Student is in fall semester
    of 10th grade, then they are taking a “Writing about…”
    class.</li>

    <li> Gwendolyn is in fall semester of
    10th grade.</li>

    <li>Therefore, Gwendolyn is taking a “Writing about”
    class.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Aristotle, a Greek philosopher who lived close
      to the time of Euclid, called this a <em class="vocab">syllogism</em>.
    A syllogism has the form</p>
  
	<ul class="bulleted">
  
    <li>If $A$ then $B$</li>

    <li>$A$</li>

    <li>Therefore, $B$.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In this example, the statements “if $A$ then $B$” and “$A$” are
      called <em class="vocab">premises</em> and “therefore, $B$” is called the <em class="vocab">conclusion</em>.
    Note that if an argument really works, if you agree with the
    premises you should also agree with the conclusion. (And if you
    don’t, that’s a sign that something is wrong with the
    argument!)</p>

    <p>Another form of argument can lead you to form an “if/then”
    statement as the conclusion. For example,</p>

    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li> If a Park Student is in fall semester
    of 10th grade, then they are taking a
    “Writing about…” class.</li>

    <li>If a student is taking a “Writing about” class, then they
    have to write a self-reflection.</li>

    <li>Therefore, if a Park student is in fall semester of 10th
    grade, then they have to write a self-reflection.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This type of argument has the form</p>

    
    <ul class="bulleted">
    <li>If $A$ then $B$</li>

    <li>If $B$ then $C$</li>

    <li>Therefore, if $A$ then $C$.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Note the important thing that allows you to
    conclude the final step is that “B” occurs as the “then” clause
    of the first statement and the “if” clause of the second
    statement.</p>

    <p>Boiling arguments down to their logical structure can be
    handy, especially when you start using the equivalence of the
    contrapositive. For example, recall the Lewis Carroll puzzle of
    problem #18:</p>

    <ul>
    <li>a) All babies are illogical.</li>

    <li>b) Nobody is despised who can manage a crocodile.</li>

    <li>c) Illogical persons are despised.</li>
            </ul>

    <p>Suppose you have managed to rewrite the puzzle this way:</p>

    <p>(from a and c) If you are a baby, then you are
    despised</p>

    <p>(from b) If you can manage a crocodile, then you are not
    despised.</p>
      


    <p>Right now the premises are written as</p>

    <p>If $A$ then $B$.</p>

    <p>If $C$ then not-$B$.</p>

    <p>It’s difficult to know what we can conclude just now, but if
    we replace the second premise with its contrapositive, “if $B$
    then not-$C$,” we can make things match up in the right
    way:</p>

    <ul style="bulleted">
    <li>If you are a baby, then you are
    despised.</li>

    <li>If you are despised, then you cannot manage a
    crocodile.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This allows us to easily see that we can conclude</p>

    <ul style="bulleted">
    <p>If you are a baby, then you cannot manage a crocodile.</p>
    </ul>
    
    <p>…which is the solution to the puzzle.</p>

    <p>For exercises 38-41 and 43-46, say what, if anything, you
    can conclude from the premises given.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In this chapter, you have proven many properties of
    triangles and quadrilaterals. You’ve known about some of these
    properties for a long time; others may have been new to you.
    You have also set about creating a structure for the
    geometry
    you know, choosing certain facts to consider as basic and
    showing how other facts depend on those. At this point, you are
    well beyond the basics, and you have probably already begun to
    make conjectures about ideas you haven’t thought about
    before.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In your notebook, use a compass to draw a circle. Then
      draw two chords of two different lengths that cross somewhere
      inside the circle. Label the endpoints of one chord $A$ and $B$,
      and the endpoints of another chord $C$ and $D$. The chords cross
      at point $E$. Now measure $\overline {AE} $, $\overline
      {EB} $, $\overline {CE} $, and $\overline {ED} $. Try
      calculating $AE \cdot EB$
       and $CE \cdot ED$.
       What do you find?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this section, most ideas that come up will probably be
    new, and many, like the result above, will be unexpected. You
    will be in a good position to make some conjectures and to
    prove many of the conjectures you make.</p>

    <p>After looking at parallel lines, triangles, and
    quadrilaterals, we’ll now turn our attention to circles. Many
    of the theorems you’ve already established will prove useful in
    investigating circles. Circles themselves often prove useful in
    analyzing other shapes, as you’ve probably realized when doing
    compass-and-straightedge constructions. In the development,
    most of your time will be spent learning the substantial
    vocabulary that has to do with circles. Then you’ll learn and
    prove
    a few basic properties of circles. In the problems section, you
    will have freer
    rein to conjecture and prove more things about circles, and
    about geometry in general.</p>

    <p>Your submarine has a rotating radar beam that is used to get
    a picture of the
    surrounding area. Your radar screen looks like this,</p>

    <p>with the bold line segment showing the motion of the radar
    beam. As the beam rotates, the screen updates based on what the
    beam finds.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why do you think the radar screen is in the shape of a

      <p>Say that you know that the circle the screen makes has a

      pointing due east? Answer this question for each
      picture below.</p>

    <p class="new-page">Recall that the ${150^ \circ }$ angle in the rightmost
      picture on the previous page is called a <em class="vocab">central angle</em>. As you can see,
    there’s a direct relationship between a central angle and the
      arc it <em class="vocab">intercepts</em>, even if the circumference of the circle is
    not 360 millimeters.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
          <p>A census taker came to a house where a man lived with
            3 daughters. “What are your daughters’ ages?” she asked.<br>
            The man replied, “The product of their ages is 36, and
            the
            sum of their ages is equal to our house number.”<br>
            “That’s still not enough information” the census taker said,
            after looking
            at the number.<br>
            “Sorry, I have to go”, the man said, “my oldest daughter
            needs help making blueberry pancakes”.</p>

          <p>      The census taker then promptly wrote down the three
            daughters’ ages and
            moved on to the next house. How did she know the ages? What
            are the ages?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <p>Some mathematics problems are challenging because they just
    do not seem to provide enough information to the reader to be
    solved. Often, though, that is because we have not looked
    carefully enough at the question and thought about what each of
      the words being used implies. To <em class="vocab">Re-examine the Problem</em> is to
    look at each and every word, term, and equation in the
    statement of the problem and to see if there is more
    information to be gleaned from them if you look more
    closely.</p>


    <p>In the problem above, at first it seems that much of the
    information given is completely unhelpful and irrelevant.
    Although there seems to be insufficient information to
    determine the daughters’ ages, that should prompt us to
    re-examine the problem to see if some of that “irrelevant”
    information can in fact be used productively. While knowing the
    product of the ages is 36 doesn’t tell us the ages of the
    daughters, it does limit the possibilities of what the ages
    could be. What are the possibilities? And although we don’t
    know the house number, the census taker does, and yet she still
    cannot say for sure what the ages are. So, which of the
    possibilities that you listed are consistent with that fact?
    And while blueberry pancakes are soon to be eaten by the man
    and his daughter, is that the only piece of additional
    information you can get from that sentence?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
        <p>Three squares are placed next to each other as shown. The
        vertices A, B,
        and C are collinear. Find the dimensions of the largest

    </div>

    <p>Sometimes, even when a problem does not seem to be all that
    complicated, we still find that there seems to be insufficient
    information. Often that is because we have not looked fully at
    what the words in the question imply. For example, although you
    likely took care to label the lengths of all 12 sides of the 3
    squares, did you ask yourself what it means for A, B, and C to
    be collinear? What do line segments AB and BC thus have in
    common? It is easy for us to “read past” certain words without
    fully grasping what they are telling us. Carefully <em class="vocab">re-examining
      the problem</em> gives us a chance to really slow down and look, as
    if with a microscope, at each individual part.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Designers, poets, mathematicians, and most everyone
    appreciates patterns.
    Our bodies and minds like patterns, such as sequences of
    behaviors and mental practices that are organized and
    efficient, like the pattern of actions you follow
    in coming to school every morning and the procedure you know to
    solve a
    particular class of problems.</p>

    <p>You saw patterns of numbers that formed sequences when you
    worked with arithmetic sequences, such as: 3, 8, 13, 18, ….
    Below are three sequences. Which two of the three share a
    common characteristic? What is that special effect?</p>

    <div class="problem">

    <div class="problem">

      each removal.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Development:
    Geometric Sequences</h2>

    <p>Earlier you considered arithmetic sequences, which are
    sequences having a
    common difference, $d$, between terms. So we would be inclined
    to describe the sequence 6, 10, 14 as an arithmetic sequence,
    for we could see the sequence
    having a first term ${T_1} = 6$ with $d=4$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The two sequences in problems 1-3 above that were similar
        are referred to as <em class="vocab">geometric sequences</em>. How would you
      describe them in English?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The next term of the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54 could be 162, as
    the sequence begins with 2 and each succeeding term can be
    created by multiplying the prior term by 3. So we could say it
    was a geometric sequence where each term after the first is
    created by multiplying by 3, so $54 \cdot 3 = 162$. We will
      call 3 the <em class="vocab">multiplier</em>, or <em class="vocab">common ratio</em>.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, 162, …, we can represent the
      first term, 2, as ${T_1}$, the second term, 6, as ${T_2}$,
      etc.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you represent the third
      term, ${T_3}$, in terms of ${T_1}$ and the
      multiplier?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you represent the fourth
      term, in terms of ${T_1}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about the $n$th term, ${T_n}$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If we had the geometric sequence 5, 10, 20, what would
      ${T_5}$ and ${T_7}$ be?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the last problem if you weren’t told that the sequence
    was geometric, you could think that the sequence 5, 10, 20, …
    wasn’t geometric. You might well
    have noticed that the successive differences between terms form
    a pattern: first 5, then 10; so this could lead you to think
    that the next term of the sequence would be 15 more than the
    prior term of 20; namely, 35. In general any
    sequence, no matter how many terms are given, is open to the
    next term being of infinite possibility — if one is clever
    enough to choose it so that it fits the form of the sequence
    terms.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the sequence had 35 after 20, how could you argue that
      the sequence wasn’t geometric?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Considering the geometric sequence: 4, 6, 9, …,</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What would you say would be the
      next two terms?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How would you write the general
      term, ${T_n}$, of the sequence?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you describe another pattern
      beginning with the terms 4, 6, and 9 that would not be
      geometric? What would be the 6th term?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Create values for $a$ and $b$ that establish patterns for
      each

      375?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How about
      $\frac{5}{2},x,\frac{{125}}{2}$? And
      $\frac{2}{5},x,\frac{2}{{125}}$?
      What is $r$, the multiplier?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Can you create a proportion for
      each of these three-term sequences so that the common ratio,
      $r$, can be easily
      observed?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What would you think the graph of a geometric sequence
      would look like? Choose some geometric sequence and draw the
      graph with the number of the term, $n$, on the
      $x$-axis and the value of the term, ${T_n}$, on the
      $y$-axis. How would you compare this image to the one
      obtained by drawing an arithmetic sequence?</p>

    <h2>Going Further: Geometric Series</h2>
    
        <p>
        As you saw with arithmetic sequences, we create an
        arithmetic series by summing the consecutive terms of such
        a sequence.</p>

        <div class="problem">
          <p>Do you recall for any arithmetic series how to express
          the sum of the first $n$ terms? If not, make up an
          arithmetic sequence and see if that triggers any
          memories.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Because we clearly didn’t want to spend time
        adding all the terms for an arithmetic series when the
        number of terms is beyond a few, we made a commitment to
        find a formula. And to do that we had to look at the series
        in an imaginative way. Well, that holds also for coming up
        with a formula for a geometric series.</p>

        <p>The clever technique that allows us to generate
        the formula for the sum of a geometric series is called
        “telescoping”. Let’s try the technique with a concrete
        instance. Suppose we are asked to find the sum of the
          geometric series: <nobr>$1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \ldots 512$.</nobr> Let’s
        call the sum $S$ and write:</p>

    <p>$S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + \ldots 512$.</p>

        <div class="problem">
          <p>Now multiply both sides by 2 (since
            <nobr>$r = 2$),</nobr> and write a new equation. Try to combine the
          two equations (by addition or subtraction) into one
          equation that gives you an “easy” way to calculate $S$.
          Can you make sense of why the method is called
          “telescoping”?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="problem">
          <p>Use your understanding of what you did in Problem 30

          $S = \frac{3}{1} + \frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{{16}} +

    <h2>Introduction:

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The town of Tinyville has been growing at a steady rate
      for many years now. Its population at the end of the last
      three years is indicated in the table below. The population
      has been growing geometrically.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What will Tinyville’s population be
    at the end of 2007? at the end of 2008? $n$ years after 2006?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What will Tinyville’s population be
    4.3 years after the end
    of 2006?</p>
      
    </div>

    <p>Your answer to Problem 1 Part b is based on an assumption —
    that is, that the formula for describing Tinyville’s population
    isn’t restricted to inputting whole numbers. In other words, it
    seems perfectly natural to assume that Tinyville’s population
    doesn’t wait until the end of the year to grow; population
    change is happening on a daily basis, if not hourly, every
    minute, or even every second. Had you been asked in the lesson
    on geometric sequences to graph the function you wrote in
    Problem 1 Part a, the graph would have looked like the graph
    shown on the left.</p>

    <p>
  <figure class="fig-25 two-up">
    <div>
      <img src="../images/08-2-modeling-with-exponential-functions/10-4-2%20Figure%201%20-%20REVISED%20O.tif.jpg" >

    <p>The dots are not connected because $t$ can only take on whole
    number values. Notice that the ordered pair $\left(
    {4.3,281839} \right)$ is not a point on this graph. The graph
    on the right (previous page) was created by assuming that t can take on
    non-integer values, such as 4.3, 1.67, or 7.3065. It is
    reasonable to assume that this graph is a more accurate
    depiction of how Tinyville’s population is growing. Both of the
    graphs show solutions to an exponential function, but it is the
    latter graph — the one in Figure 2 — that we will be studying
    at this point.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>To help us transition from the discrete aspect of the
    geometric sequence graphed in Figure 1 to the continuous aspect
    of the function graphed in Figure 2, we will introduce some
    notation. The equation for the first figure could be ${P_n} =
    232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^n}$, where $n \ge 0$.
    Unfortunately, this kind of subscripting doesn’t allow for
    ${P_{4.3}}$: there is no such thing as the 4.3rd term of the
    sequence. We can get around this difficulty by replacing the
    ${P_n}$ with $P\left( n \right)$ and writing the equation
    as $P\left( n \right) = 232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^n}$.
    Just as with Twist($x$,$y$) or Oblongness($a$,$b$), you don’t multiply
    $P$ by $n$. We read this equation as “$P$ of $n$ equals…” $P\left( 2
    \right)$ is the population two years after 2006 (i.e.,
    $232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^2} \approx 254423$), and
    $P\left( {4.3} \right)$ is the population 4.3 years after 2006
    (i.e., $232760{\left( {1.0455} \right)^{4.3}} \approx 281839$). This notation is called <em class="vocab">function notation</em> or <em class="vocab">Euler notation.</em></p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Calculate $P\left( {6.3} \right)$ and explain the meaning
      of this number in the context of the problem.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If $f\left( x \right) = 5{x^2}$ and $g\left( t \right) = 3
      \cdot {2^t}$, then calculate each of the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$f\left( 2 \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$g\left( 2 \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">$f\left( { - 1} \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <p>An <em class="vocab">exponential function</em> is any function that can be
    written in the form $f\left( x \right) = a \cdot {b^x}$, where
    $a &gt; 0,{\rm{ }}b &gt; 0,$ and $b \ne 1$. We will take a
    look at these
    restrictions on $a$ and $b$ shortly, but first let’s explore a
    couple more problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Look back at the work you did in Problem 1. When will
      the population of Tinyville reach 500,000? Use your
      calculator to help you answer this questions with 3-decimal
      place accuracy — i.e., correctly rounded to three digits
      after the decimal point.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>By what percentage does Tinyville’s population grow from
      year to year? This number is often called the <em class="vocab">annual
        percentage growth rate</em>. Where does this number show
      up in your expression describing Tinyville’s population
      $t$ years after 2006?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Tinyville’s rival town is Punyville. Punyville’s
      population at the end of 2004 had reached 375,000 but was now
      starting to decline geometrically. Its population at the end
      of each of the past three years is shown in the table

      <p>Recall that the average speed of an object over a
      particular time interval is determined by the distance that
      it covers during that time period divided by the length of
      that time period. What was the average speed of the ball
      during the first second?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What was the average speed of the ball during the time
      interval from $t = 0.6$ to $t = 0.7$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What was the average speed of the ball during the time
      interval from $t = 0.7$ to $t = 0.8$?</p>

    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Approximately how fast was the ball going at $t = 0.3$ seconds?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="page-break">The average speed of the ball during the time interval $t =
    0.6$ to $t = 0.7$ should have been equivalent to calculating
    the change in the ball’s height divided by the amount of time
    during this change. In other words,</p>

    <p>
    $\textrm{average speed } = \textrm{ }\frac{{\textrm{change in
    height}}}{{\textrm{time taken}}} = \frac{{\left( {\textrm{final
    height}} \right) - \left( {\textrm{initial height}}
    \right)}}{{\left( {\textrm{final time}} \right) - \left(
    {\textrm{initial time}} \right)}}$.</p>

    <p>While you may not have used this exact formula to do
    Problems 1-3, you
    probably used the reasoning encapsulated by the formula. But
    how did you
    arrive at an answer to Problem 4? Well, your answers to
    Problems 2 and 3
    give you estimates of the ball’s speed 1/10th of a second
    before $t = 0.7$ seconds and 1/10th of a second after $t = 0.7$ seconds. Since the ball probably didn’t make any strange
    movements right at $t = 0.7$ (suddenly stop, suddenly jump up
    to 100 feet and instantaneously fall back to 25.16 feet, et
    cetera), then averaging your answers to Problems 2 and 3 would
    be a reasonable way of estimating the speed of the ball at $t =
    0.7$ seconds. This is just one way of trying to estimate the
    speed of an object at a particular time. We will look at a few
    other ways and also see how average speed (more generally known
    as average rate of change) relates to some other interesting
    concepts.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Let’s take another look at average speed and speed at a
    moment in time, this time by investigating an equation.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Ben has a wicked fastball — wicked in that it speeds up as
      it moves toward the plate. A fairly reasonable model for this
      pitch is $d\left( t \right) = 130{\left( 2 \right)^t} - 130$, where $d\left( t \right)$ stands for the distance (in feet)
      that the ball has traveled since it left Ben’s hand after t
      time (in seconds).</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What was the average speed of the
      ball during the time interval from $t = 0.1$ to $t = 0.2$?
      If you’re not sure what to do here then think about how you
      did Problem 1 and how you can get this problem to be more
      like Problem 1.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What was the average speed of the
      ball during the time interval from $t = 0.2$ to $t = 0.3$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">The calculation you performed in
      Part b can be seen as the slope of a specific line. Explain
      why this is true.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Below is shown a graph of $d\left(
      t \right) = 130{\left( 2 \right)^t} - 130$ over the time
      interval $0 \le t \le 0.5$. On the axes below, carefully,
      and as accurately as possible, draw the line referred to in
      Part c.
      Extend the line enough so that someone looking at your work
      can see that the line is different from the curve.</p>
  <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/08-3-exponential-functions/10-4-3_diagram_6d.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, repeat what you did in Part d
      but draw the line that corresponds to the calculation you did
      in Part a. Make
      sure someone looking at your work can tell the difference
      between the lines.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Approximately what was the speed of
      the ball at $t = 0.2$ seconds?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">There is a line that just touches
      the graph of $d\left( t \right) = 130{\left( 2 \right)^t} -
      130$ at $t = 0.2$. This line does not pass through the
      graph. On the axes above, draw this line.
      Again, make sure to draw this line so that it can be seen
      to be different from the other two that you drew.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate as accurately as possible
      the slope of the line you drew in Part g. How does this slope
      compare to your answer in Part f?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the speed of the ball at
      $t = 0.3$ seconds and then again at $t = 0.4$ seconds? Is the
      ball speeding up?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the line that
      just touches the graph at $t = 0.45$. What does this number
      tell you about the ball?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The line that you drew in Problem 6 Part g is called a
      <em class="vocab">tangent line</em>. By definition we say that the <em class="vocab">slope of a curve</em> at
    a specific point is the slope of the tangent line at that
    point. So, the slope of the curve $d\left( t \right) =
    130{\left( 2 \right)^t} - 130$ at $t = 0.2$ is approximately 103.508. Also, since the variable graphed on
    the vertical axis
    is distance and the variable graphed on the horizontal axis is
    time, our slope calculation</p>

    <p>
    $\frac{{{d_2} - {d_1}}}{{{t_2} - {t_1}}} = \frac{{\textrm{change
    in distance}}}{{\textrm{change in time}}}$</p>

    <p>gives us the speed of the ball, 103.508 feet/second
    (approximately 70.6 mph).</p>

    <p>If we’re looking at a physical situation that involves
    distance versus time, we have seen how speed and slope of the
    curve are related. Let’s look at what more the slope of a curve
    can tell us.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph the function $y = {2^x}$ on paper over the interval
      $- 3 \le x \le 3$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the curve at
      $x = - 2,\, - 1,\,\,0,\,\,1,\textrm{ and }2$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How will the slope of the curve
      change as the value of $x$ increases beyond the value of $x =
      2$? How will it change as the value of $x$ decreases from $x =
      - 2$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Use your calculations in Part a to
      explain why $y = {2^x}$ is not a linear function.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph the function $y = {0.7^x}$ on paper over the
      interval $- 3 \le x \le 3$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Calculate $\frac{{{{0.7}^{2.001}} -
      {{0.7}^2}}}{{2.001 - 2}}$ and explain the meaning of this
      number in the context of this problem.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Is it reasonable to think of your
      calculation in Part a as an estimate of the slope of the
      curve at $x = 2$? How can you get an even better
      estimate?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the curve at
      $x = - 2,\, - 1,\,\,0,\,\,1,\textrm{ and }2$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write an expression that would
      represent an estimate of the slope of the curve at $x = b.$
      This expression should have $b$ along with some constants.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Looking back at your solution to
      Part d, for what value(s) of $x$ is the slope of the curve less
      than -1?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are there any values for $x$ for
      which the slope of the curve is 0? You might visualize what
      the tangent line would look like in order to solve this
      problem.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Your work in Problems 7 and 8 should have given you some
    idea of how you can use the slope of a curve to determine
    whether the curve is linear. Also, how the slope of the curve
    changes can give you some sense of what is happening to the
    curve.</p>

    <p>We will add only one thing more to our understanding of the
    slope of the curve.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A rabbit population is growing according to the model
      $R(t) = 200{(1.02)^t}$, where t is measured in days.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate the slope of the curve at
      $t = 3$. What does this number tell you about the rabbit
      population? Be specific.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">At what rate (rabbits/days) is the
      population increasing
      at 6 days?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What is the daily percentage growth
      rate of the rabbit
      population?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Why are your numerical answers to
      Parts a, b, and c all
      different from each other?</p>
    </div>

    <p>As you may have surmised from the previous problem, “growth
    rate” is a
    somewhat ambiguous term: you need to know whether the rate is a
    percentage growth rate (your answer to Part c and the number
    that is built into the model) or an absolute growth rate (your
    answers to Parts a and b). Moreover, the slope of the curve
    tells you how two quantities change with respect to each
    other,
    not necessarily how one quantity changes with respect to
    itself, which is what percentage change has to do with.</p>

    <h2>Problems</h2>
    <p>Throughout the problems in this section and the next, you’ll
    need to pay close attention to the information presented,
    particularly what is implied by the information. For example,
    when you’re told that the ball has hit the ground, this should
    mean to you that its height is zero, and you can bring this
    information into your calculations. Thinking carefully about
    the implications of the terms and information in a problem is
    part of our habit
    re-examine the problem and will come in handy in solving many
    problems.</p>

      <p>A baseball is shot from a cannon so
      that its height $h$ (in feet) above the
      ground at time $t$ (in seconds) is given
      by $h(t) = -16t^2 + 128t +4$.</p>

      <p>Robert and Allan each throw a baseball
      at the same time. The height (in feet)
      of Robert’s ball above the ground
      after t seconds is given by $R(t) = - 16{t^2} + 50t + 5$.

      <p>Let $f(x) = \sqrt x $ and $g(x) = 4 - 4({0.5^x})$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Kiran was calculating the slope of
      f at x and thought he could express his answer in two
      equivalent ways: $\frac{{\sqrt {x + .001} - \sqrt x
      }}{{.001}}$ and $\frac{{\sqrt x + \sqrt {.001} - \sqrt x
      }}{{.001}}$. Give two explanations for why these
      expressions are not equivalent: one involving algebra and the
      other involving slope.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Kiran then calculated the slope
      of
      $g$ at $x$ and wrote $\frac{4-4(0.5^{x+.001}) - (4 - 4(0.5^x))}{.001}$.
      Show how this expression can be rewritten as $\frac{4(0.5^{x+.001})(1-4(0.5^x))}{.001}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">As $x$ increases, what happens to the
      slope of $f$? of $g$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Kiran argues that, given what’s
      happening in Part c, both functions should be doing
      essentially the same thing as $x$ goes toward infinity. What do
      you think?</p>

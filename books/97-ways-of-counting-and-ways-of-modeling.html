    <div class="problem-content">
      <p>At Arnaldo’s small party, people shook hands with as many
      people they liked, from 0 up to everyone else at the party.
      Nayla has been paying close attention, and says that if you
      add up everyone’s personal “handshake total”, you will get
      15. Can she be correct? Explain.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p>Often in life, when someone says something that seems
    surprising, counter-intuitive, or even reasonable, we will look
    not at the conviction with which the speaker is speaking, but
    instead for the evidence and reasoning needed to back up their
    claim. In mathematics, we do the same thing. It is a fun fact
    of mathematics that many things that initially appear to be
    false are in fact true, and as well many things that appear to
    be true are false. So the only way to know if a statement is
    correct is to use clear reasoning based on assumptions we all
    agree upon.</p>

    <p>Proving is a way of demonstrating to yourself and others
    that something you think may be true (or false), must in fact
    be true (or false). Although there are many different ways of
    proving a statement, everyone agrees that the steps of a proof
    should be clear: a careful reader should be able to read each
    step of your proof and see how it connects and follows from the
    one before. That way, at the conclusion of your proof, they
    will agree with you!</p>

    <p>In the “Arnaldo’s party” problem above, at first it may seem
    a bit mystifying how to approach testing Nayla’s claim.
    Probably the best thing to do at first is to Tinker by trying
    to see if you can get a “handshake total” for all party members
    to be equal or close to 15. If you can get to exactly 15,
    you’re done; Nayla is correct, and the problem is over. On the
    other hand, if you have tried a number of different handshake
    “scenarios” and only gotten close to 15 in each case,
    nevertheless you will probably have noticed something
    interesting about handshake totals in general—something you
    might try to prove (and which will tell us if Nayla can be
    correct as well).</p>

    <p>So, when presented with a claim, do three things. First,
    decide whether it seems reasonable – do you believe it at first
    glance? Next, try to find evidence that the claim is or is not
    true. Finally, for any claim that you believe to be true, try
    to prove that it’s true by making a sequence of logical
    statements, each of which your peers could understand and agree
    to; and for any claim you believe to be false, provide an
    example that shows the claim is false—such an example is called
    a counterexample.</p>

    <p>Here’s a problem that many students have enjoyed:</p>

    <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
      <figure class="fig-50">  
       <img src="../images/09-0-prove/Prove checkerboard.png">
      </figure>
      <p>A 64-square black and white checkerboard (see above) can
      clearly be completely covered by 32 dominos. If the top right
      and bottom left squares are removed, what is left is a
      62-square board. How many dominoes will be required to cover
        the 62-square board?</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
    <div class="problem-content">
      <p>[Continuation of problem 2] Did you check your answer to
      problem 2? A 64 square checkerboard is covered by 32 dominoes
      since every domino covers 2 squares, a white one and a black
      one. In the altered checkerboard, how many black squares are
      there? How many white squares? Would 31 dominoes do the
      job?</p>
    </div>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s another problem that might seem very tricky at first,
    but with a little persistence and some tinkering . . .</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <div class="problem-content">
      <p>In a stock market game, Traci claims that she can purchase
      any stock above $\$26$ by using only $\$5$ and $\$6$ coupons. (For
      example, there is no way she could purchase $\$13$ of stock with
      these coupons, but she could purchase $\$41$ of stock by using
      one $\$6$ coupon and seven $\$5$ coupons.) Do you think that Traci
      can really pull this off?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

    <p>As a token of our affection to you, the answer is given on
    the reverse.</p>

    <p class="new-page">While it may seem plausible that there is always some
    combination of $\$5$ and $\$6$ coupons that is equivalent to a
    specific amount of money, it at first seems unlikely that we
    may be able to prove that any amount over $\$26$ can be produced
    by some combination of the two coupons. How would we know for
    sure that $\$329876$ could be paid out?</p>

    <p>Our best strategy is to begin by tinkering, and then see if
    there are any interesting patterns that emerge. We can then try
    to establish through careful reasoning that the patterns we see
    are no fluke, that they have to continue.</p>

    <p>So let’s start.</p>

    <p>The first few dollar amounts one can figure out just by
    tinkering:</p>

    <p>$\$27$ stock can be paid by using three $\$5$ coupons and two $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$28$ stock can be paid by using two $\$5$ coupons and three $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$29$ stock can be paid by using one $\$5$ coupon and four $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$30$ stock can be paid by using no $\$5$ coupons and five $\$6$
    coupons.</p>

    <p>$\$31$ stock can be paid by using five $\$5$ coupons and one $\$6$
    coupon.</p>

    <p>Wait a second. Isn’t this sort of tedious? Doesn’t it seem
    like this approach would take us forever, and even then we
    would still have an infinity of numbers left to check? And
    weren’t we supposed to look for a pattern? There doesn’t seem
    to be any pattern in the $\$5$’s and $\$6$’s at all.</p>

    <p>Well, let’s think about a $\$32$ stock. Traci knows how to
    purchase a $\$27$ stock—three $\$5$ coupons and two $\$6$ coupons. What
    coupon should she now add in order to purchase a $\$32$ stock?</p>

    <p>Now convince yourself that Traci’s claim is valid.</p>

<article>

  <section class="development">


    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>An explorer is lost in the 30 by 60 mile rectangular section
    of snowy wilderness shown below. The search and rescue team
    knows that she started her journey at the southwest corner, and
    since there hasn’t been any new snow for a while, they also
    know that they’ll be able to see her tracks.</p>
    
 <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/09-1-algorithms/Wilderness.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    
    <p>Obviously, the team wants to find the lost explorer as
    quickly as possible. There are different ideas about how to do
    this, though, so they decide to split into
    two groups. Group A will start at the southwest corner and
    simply follow the explorer’s trail. Group B, though, has a
    different strategy. Here’s what they do:</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Group B starts out at $\left( {0,30} \right)$, and
      walks directly east. Every
      time they cross the explorer’s trail, they make a note of it.
      Suppose that by the time they reach the eastern border,
      they’ve crossed the explorer’s trail 5 times. What can they
      conclude about where the explorer must be now? How about if
      they’d crossed the trail 8 times?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>As you can see, Group B’s west-to-east walk allows them to
      cut the remaining search area in half. Their idea is to keep
      repeating this until they’ve narrowed down the search area to
      a small horizontal strip. Suppose that on the first walk
      (along $y = 30$), they crossed the trail 3 times.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What horizontal line should they
      walk next?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now, suppose that on the second
      walk, they cross the
      explorer’s trail 6 times. Where could the explorer possibly
      be? Demonstrate your answer by drawing a picture of one such
      trail the explorer could have taken.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem allow-break">

      <p>Is Group B’s strategy better than Group A’s? To help you
      answer this question, determine approximately how long each
      one would take to find the lost explorer in each of
      the following scenarios. (Assume that each group moves at the
      same speed, and that as soon as a group comes within
      a mile or so, they’ll see the explorer’s signal flares.)</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>The two strategies in the situation above are both examples
      of <em class="vocab">algorithms</em>— though, of course, Group A’s is a rather
    simple one. An <em class="vocab">algorithm</em> is simply a clearly defined,
    step-by-step process for accomplishing a desired task. You can
    think of every algorithm as having three main parts: input,
    process and output. In the search and rescue situation, for
    example, the input would be the whole search area and the
    explorer’s trail, and the output would be the explorer’s
    location.</p>

    <p>As you can hopefully see, thinking about and analyzing
    algorithms can be
    useful in situations where there are multiple possible
    approaches, and we want the “best” or most efficient one. But
    this kind of thinking isn’t only useful in practical
    applications — it’s also a source of some classic games and
    puzzles.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The Number Devil is thinking of an integer between 1 and
      63 (inclusive), and your job is to guess it. If you guess
      wrong, the Number Devil will tell you (truthfully) whether
      your guess is too low or too high. Come up with a strategy
      for finding the Number Devil’s number in as few guesses as
      possible.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Was there anything in common between your strategy in the
    previous problem and Group B’s approach to finding the missing
    explorer? Group B’s strategy — and, likely, yours — is an
    example of a <em class="vocab">binary search</em> algorithm. (The Latin root $bini$ means “two-by-two”.) Here’s another application of it.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your English teacher has an alphabetized stack of 15
      papers,
      but she’s forgotten whose papers she collected. Now, she
      needs to check and see if she has Gabi’s paper in the stack.
      She decides to use a binary search algorithm.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Simulate this with your group: have
      a group member make an alphabetized list of names without
      showing you. The list maker gets to decide whether or not
      “Gabi” is in the list. You, in the role of the teacher, can
      ask for any individual name in the list (e.g., “Who is the
      fifth person in the list?”). How many times do you have to
      ask before you can be sure whether or not Gabi’s name is in
      the stack?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Make up an alphabetized list of 15
      names that would
      force the teacher’s binary search process to make the most
      guesses possible. This is called a “worst case” input for
      the
      algorithm. How many guesses does the algorithm take,
      in the worst case?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Now, you decide to play a little trick on the teacher.
      Carefully rearrange the ordering of names you made in part
      b of the previous problem so that, when your teacher uses
      binary search, she’ll end up mistakenly concluding that
      Gabi’s paper is not in the stack.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Based on what happened in problem 6, it’s clear that there
    are certain situations in which the binary search algorithm
    isn’t appropriate. This is always true: every algorithm makes
    some assumptions about its input.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What assumption(s) did the teacher make in using her
      binary search algorithm?</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">In addition to thinking carefully about the input, it’s also
    helpful when working with algorithms to identify the <em class="vocab">basic operations</em> your algorithm can use. The basic operations are
    always based on the situation you’re dealing with: they are
    the
    actions you’re able to do as a single “step” of your algorithm.
    In the Number Devil game, for example, your basic operation was
    to guess a number and find out if it was correct, too big, or
    too small. In the stack of papers example,
    the basic operation was to check the name on a single paper in
    the stack and compare it alphabetically with the name ‘Gabi’.
    The basic operation in the
    following game is similar to these two, but slightly
    different.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Play the following game with a classmate:</p>
    

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Your partner should write
    five different numbers on slips of paper. Then shuffle the
    papers and put them face down on the table in a straight
    row.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">You are the guesser. Your
    job is to figure out which paper has the largest number written
    on it. But you can never
    see the numbers themselves — you can only ask for
    comparisons. For example, you could point to the first
    slip and the fourth slip, and your classmate would have
    to tell you which one has the larger number.</p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Each comparison counts as
    one step, and your goal is to find the paper with the largest
    number with as few steps as possible.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Play the game and identify the paper
    with the largest
    number. How many steps did it take before you were
    certain about your answer?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Describe, in detail, an algorithm for
    finding the largest
    number in a list of numbers, using as few comparisons
    as possible.</p>
      
      </div>
    
    <div class="problem">
      <p>Aaron has an algorithm that he claims can find the largest
      number every time using only three comparisons. Either figure
      out Aaron’s algorithm, or explain why it’s impossible.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">Here’s a somewhat different algorithmic puzzle that many
    consider a “modern classic.” (In fact, the story goes that,
    before it got out onto the Internet, this was a question that
    Google interviewers asked of potential employees.)</p>

    <p>You have two perfectly identical eggs. You need to figure
    out how high an egg can fall from a 100-story building before
    it breaks. You know nothing about the toughness of the eggs;
    they may be very fragile and break when dropped from the first
    floor. On the other hand, they may be super tough genetically
    altered eggs, so tough that that dropping them from the 100th
    floor doesn’t even cause a scratch. The only thing you know for
    sure is that they both have exactly the same “toughness.”</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Joey takes his first egg, and drops it off of the fourth
      floor. It doesn’t break. Then, he goes up and drops it off
      the tenth floor, and it shatters spectacularly on the
      sidewalk. Finally, he takes his second (and last) egg, and
      drops it off the seventh floor. It breaks. What can Joey
      conclude about the toughness of his eggs?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Come up with a strategy for figuring out your eggs’
      toughness. Your job is to guarantee the smallest
      number of egg-drops, in the worst case. You are
      allowed to break both eggs, but remember, two is all
      you get!</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="new-page">Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You have 16 identical-looking coins. Fifteen of them have
      exactly the same weight, and one is too heavy. Describe
      an algorithm for finding the heavy coin in as few steps as
      possible. The basic operation allowed is to use a simple
      balance to compare 2 piles of coins to see which pile is
      heavier.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>In the algorithm you use for adding two very large numbers
      by hand, what are the basic operations? How about multiplying
      two numbers by hand? Dividing?</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Describe the mental algorithm a street vendor might

    <div class="problem">

      years old.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Recall the Number Devil game from problem 4. Now let’s say
      you’re trying to guess a number between 1 and 255. If you
      were going to play using the binary search algorithm, what
      would be one worst-case number that the Number Devil could
      choose?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the following strategy to the egg-drop
      problem:</p>
  
    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow"><em>Starting at floor 1,
    drop the first egg off of odd-numbered floors until it breaks.
    Then, go back down one floor and drop the second egg. If it
    breaks, that’s the answer. If not, then the floor above is the
      answer.</em></p>

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Say you get to decide how
    tough the eggs are, and you want to force the strategy above to
    make the largest possible number of drops before it
    succeeds.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What is the worst-case
    input for this strategy?
    i.e., how tough should you make the eggs?</p>

    <p class="problem-part"> What’s the worst-case
    number of drops?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <p>The algorithms we’ve worked with so far dealt with lists of
    information, whether they were lists of numbers, names, phone
    numbers, etc. Now, we’re going to look at algorithms that
    transform a single item, such as a number, word, etc.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You and your friend are planning to share lockers, so as
      soon as you get your combinations, you plan to exchange them
      over the phone. Each combination has three numbers in it –
      for example, 11 – 2 – 41.</p>

      <p>In case someone might be listening, though, you agree ahead
      of time to use the following algorithm to encrypt each number
      in the combination:</p>

      <p>      ${\mathop{\rm EncryptNumber}\nolimits} \left( N \right)$:</p>
      <p>If $N$ is odd, then output $2 + N$.<br>
      Otherwise, output $2 \cdot N$.</p>
 

    <p class="Development---Problem-Flow">Notice that the notation
    being used here is similar to the “function notation” that
    you’ve seen in some previous
    lessons. “EncryptNumber” is the name of the algorithm, and $N$ is
    a name for the input to the algorithm.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your combination is 12 – 7 – 11. What
    should you tell
    your friend?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">Your friend tells you 80 – 28 – 29.
    What was her
    combination?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Your brother wants to use the same system with his friend,
      but he’s confused about how it’s possible to “decrypt” the
      numbers he receives. Give him detailed instructions for a
      “DecryptNumber” algorithm that he can use to understand what
      his friend tells him.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One convenient feature of using function notation is that we
    can use it to easily write down things about what an algorithm
    does for specific inputs. For example, we can write
    ${\rm{EncryptNumber}}\left( 4 \right) = 8$, or
    ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( 8 \right) = 4$.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {13} \right)$? How
      about ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {24} \right)$? And
      ${\rm{DecryptNumber}}\left( {18} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Predict what would happen if you applied the EncryptNumber
      algorithm to each of your three answers in the previous
      problem. Then try it out to test your prediction.</p>
    </div>

    <p>When you use an algorithm to encode a message so that no
    strangers can understand it, it’s called an “encryption”
    algorithm. This is essentially what a computer does when you
    enter a password or other personal information on a website, so
    that nobody besides the website owner can see it.</p>

    <p>Another kind of encoding is called “compression”. With
    compression, the idea is to shrink the size of a message down
    so it’s faster to transport. This is why mp3’s are such a big
    deal: they allow you to compress very large song files so that
    they’re small enough to download quickly.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Emmett wants to compress all the old emails he’s saved on
      his computer. Thinking of the shorthand he sometimes uses for
      text messages, he decides to go through each message and

      <p>What are some characteristics that would make a good

    <p>You saw with the compression and encryption algorithms above
      that they’re only useful if they also have <em>de</em>compression and
      <em>de</em>cryption algorithms to go with them. These are two examples
      of a more general type of algorithm called an <em class="vocab">inverse</em>
      algorithm. When you have two algorithms, and each one reverses
      the other, then the two algorithms are called <em class="vocab">inverses</em> of each
    other. Using this language, we can say the major flaw in
    Emmett’s compression algorithm was that it has no inverse
    algorithm. (Why not?)</p>

      <p>You want to share your gym locker with a different friend

    If $N$ is odd, then output $2N$.<br>

      <p class="problem-part">This strategy will usually work, but
      not for every pair of numbers. When is this strategy
      non-reversible?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Create your own strategy, and show
      that it works — that it is reversible.</p>

      <p>Look back at the sorting algorithm you wrote for problem
      39.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Are there certain initial

      <p class="problem-part">Using your algorithm, what’s the
      maximum number of comparisons you have to make, in the worst
      case, when you play the game with five cards?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">If you used your sort algorithm
      from problem 39 to sort a list with $N$ items in it, how many

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Five pirates come across 100 bars of gold. The pirates
      have a pecking order, with #5 and #1 indicating the top and
      bottom-ranked pirates, respectively. Each pirate wants to
      maximize his or her share of the gold bars. There are no
      coalitions or
      collusions between them. They are all very analytical — they
        can think things through!</p>


      <p>Their process for splitting the loot is somewhat democratic.
      It begins with the top-ranked pirate making a proposal on how
      to divvy up the loot. (Note that the gold bars cannot be
      broken up, glued
      together, or otherwise changed; there are 100 bars of gold,
      period.) Each pirate
      gets one vote, up or down on the entire proposal. Remember,
      each pirate votes based on his or her own pocket and there
      are no side agreements of any sort. If the proposal gets 50%
      or more votes, it wins, and that’s that. On the other hand,
      if it fails to muster 50%, then the pirate who made the
      proposal is thrown overboard, and the process continues with
      the next pirate down the hierarchy.</p>

      <p>What is the maximum number of bars that the most powerful
      pirate can get and what allocation to each pirate will ensure
      him the 50% vote that he needs?</p>

Logarithms

<article>

  <section class="development">




    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The following tree diagrams, which are called <em class="vocab"> binary trees</em>,
    are all based on the same system for organizing
    information.</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Logarithms intro binary trees.png">
    </figure>
    
    <p>Each item (phone number, animal, letter) in the tree is
    called a “node”, and the nodes immediately below a node are
    called its “children”. As you can see, each node in the tree
    has at most two children. Furthermore, notice that as you start
    at the top and travel down the branches, every descendant down
    the right branch of a given node is somehow more than (or
    larger than, or after) that node, whereas every descendent to
    the left is somehow less.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Let’s say we wanted to add the number “866-3162” to the
      phone number tree above. Even though it comes after
      “393-1765”, it would be wrong to hang it to the right of that
      number, because that would still be down the left branch from
      “555-1791”. Where should “866-3162” go? How about “squirrel”
      and “k” in their respective trees? There is only one correct
      answer for each of these.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Ask a group member to write down, without showing you, a
      list of 10 different numbers. Your group member will be
      reading the list to you one number at a time, and your job is
      to organize them into a binary search tree <em>as they’re being
        read to you</em>. There’s one rule: unlike in nature, these trees
      grow down. This means, for example, that the first number
      your group member reads will have to be the one at the very
      top of your tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Have your group member read the
      numbers to you, giving you time to add each number to the
      tree, without rearranging the ones you’ve added so far,
      before reading the next one out.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What would have happened if the
      numbers had been read to you in a different order? Try it and
      see.</p>
    </div>

    <p>In these small examples, it’s quite easy to see all the
    information at once, so they’re not necessarily any better than
    just writing out a simple list. Imagine, though, that instead
    of the 7 phone numbers in the first diagram, you had a binary
    tree with hundreds of phone numbers in it. (By the way, this is
    essentially how a cell phone really does store phone
    numbers.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Alice the ant starts at the top node of this large phone
      number tree and wants to know if the exterminator’s number,
      which she knows by heart, is in it. (She’s hoping it’s not!)
      Because Alice is so small, she can only read one node at a
      time, and she has to crawl down a branch to read another
      number.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Describe a simple algorithm she can
      use to find out where the exterminator’s number would have to
      be, if it were in the tree.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Which of the following trees do you
      think Alice would rather search? Remember the old saying:
      when you’re trying to find something, it’s always in the last
      place you look!</p>
    </div>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Trees.tif.jpg" >
    </figure>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>You saw from problem 2 that there is more than one possible
    “shape” that a binary tree can take, even with the same raw
    data.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>For each of the following, come up with a sequence of
      items, which, if you used your approach from problem 2, would
      end up in a binary tree with the given shape. (The items can
      be anything you want: names, numbers, etc.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part"> 
        <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image5.tif.jpg" >
        </figure>
      </p>
      
      <p class="problem-part">
          <figure class="fig-25">
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image6.tif.jpg" >
           </figure>
      </p>
      
      <p class="problem-part"> 
          <figure class="fig-25">
        <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image7.tif.jpg" >
           </figure>
      </p>
    </div>

    <p>The <em class="vocab">depth of a node</em> in a tree is the number of branches it
    is away from the top. So, for example, “chicken” in the animal
      tree has a depth of 2. The <em class="vocab">depth of the whole tree</em> is just the
    depth of its deepest node. (So the animal tree has a depth of
    3, because “mouse”, the deepest node, has a depth of 3.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Rearrange the lists of items you used in problem 4 so that
      the resulting trees have the minimum possible depth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Do the same for the list your group used in problem 2.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="new-page">The trees you made in problem 5 are examples of <em class="vocab">balanced</em>
    binary trees, whereas the one you made in problem 6 is not
    balanced. To see why, think of the tree like a hanging mobile:
    if each node is perfectly balanced, then the whole thing is
    balanced.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is it possible to arrange the numbers 1 through 7 into a
      balanced binary tree? How about 1 through 12? 1 through
      15?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A <em class="vocab">leaf</em> of a tree is a node that doesn’t have any children.
      Notice that in a balanced binary tree, all the leaves have
      the same depth. If a balanced binary tree has 512 leaves,
      then what is the depth of the tree?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Of course, not all trees have to be binary. If you
      continued
      the regular pattern of the tree below, how many leaves would
      the next level of the tree have? How deep would it need to be
      in order to have 4096 leaves?</p>

        <figure class="fig-50">
    <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/image8.tif.jpg" >
  </figure>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>On some ancient computers, passwords had to consist of
      only the letters A through E. If I tell you that on these
      computers, there were 15625 passwords, and all of the
      passwords had to be the same length, can you say how many
      letters were required in a password?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the last three problems, you were effectively looking for
    exponents. You might have found yourself asking, in rather
    awkward English, the question:</p>

    <p>\[ \text{5 to the } what \ power \text{ equals 15625?} \]</p>
   
    <p>Fortunately, there’s a mathematical term for the number
      we’re looking for here: it’s called “the <em class="vocab">logarithm</em>, base 5, of
    15625”. Symbolically, it’s written <nobr>“${\log _5}\left( {15625}
      \right)$”.</nobr></p>

    <p class="new-page">So our awkward question is now both easier to pronounce:</p>

    <p>$$\rm{What \; is \; the \; log, base \; 5, of \; 15625?}$$</p>

    <p>and easier to write:</p>

    <p>$$\log_5 (15625)=x.$$</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Translate the equation above into an equation involving
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Go back and set up problems 8-10 with equations using log
      notation. (No need to solve them again—just set them up.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Use symbols to create a formal definition for what it
        means to say that <nobr>“$y$ is the log, base $b$, of $x$”.</nobr> Your
      definition should have the form:
        “(<em>equation involving</em> log) if and only if (<em>equation
      involving
        exponents</em>)”.</p>

<p>      This is something you can refer to whenever you need to
      translate to and from “log” notation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Practice</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Consider the following binary tree.</p>
   

    <figure class="fig-50">
      <img src="../images/09-2-logarithms/Logarithms leter tree.png" >
    </figure>

    <p class="problem-part">Assuming this tree was built
    similarly to the one you built in problem 2, what order could
    the letters have been added in?</p>

    <p class="problem-part">What ordering would you use to
    produce a tree with the greatest possible depth?</p>
    
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Determine the depth of each of the trees described
      below.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">A balanced binary tree that has
      1,048,576 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Every node that isn’t a leaf has 4
      children. There are 64 leaves.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Every non-leaf node has 6 children,
      and there are $X$ leaves. (Answer in terms of $X$, using log
      notation.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Unlike on this planet, primordial amoebas from Mars
      reproduce by splitting into three children. If life on Mars
      started with a single amoeba, but now there are 1,594,323
      amoebas, then:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Estimate, without using a
      calculator, for how many
      amoeba-generations there has been life on Mars.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Now rewrite the question as a
      logarithm, and find
      an exact answer (calculator allowed this time).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Translate the following awkward bits of English into log
      notation. (Notice that some are complete sentences, and
      others are fragments.)</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“What number could I raise 4 to, to
      get 64?”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The power of 3 that gives you
      81”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“4 to the <em>something-or-other</em> power
      equals 1024.”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The number to which 6 must be
      raised in order to produce 216”</p>

      <p class="problem-part">“The number of times, starting with
        1, that you have to double to <nobr>get $x$”</nobr></p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Calculate the value of each of the following:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _3}\left( {81} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{13}}\left( {169}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _8}\left( {512} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{11}}\left( {14,641}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{100}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{1,000}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{10}}\left( {1,000,000}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{15}}\left( {11,390,625}
      \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Going Further</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Start with $x = 243$. Check with your calculator that
      ${\log _3}\left( x \right) = 5$. How much do you have to add
      to $x$ to make ${\log _3}\left( x \right)$ go up by one? Up by
      two? Three?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since the number 3 is not one of the powers of 9, it’s not
    clear just what this question means, or how to find out what
    the value of ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right)$ would be.
    Remember, though, that it’s also possible to have non-integer
    exponents. Let’s see if we can use that to find an answer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Start by rewriting ${\log _9}\left( 3 \right) = x$ in
      exponential form. Then, try tinkering with different ways to
      write this equation by applying some of your rules of
      exponents.</p>
    </div>

    <p>You might have noticed in the problem above that it was much
    simpler to solve once you’d rewritten “3” as
    “${9^{{\raise0.5ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle 1$}
    \kern-0.1em/\kern-0.15em \lower0.25ex\hbox{$\scriptstyle
    2$}}}}$”. In the next problem, try using a similar strategy:
    tinker with different ways of rewriting things, using the
    definition of logarithms and your exponent rules. (You might
    want to take a minute with your group to remind yourselves of
    all the rules.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the value of each of the following without using a
      calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _4}\left( {32} \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _5}\left( {\frac{1}{{25}}}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _{10}}\left( {0.000000001}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">${\log _7}\left( 1 \right)$</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Why can you be sure that ${\log _2}\left( {42} \right)$ is
      not an integer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find every number from 1 to 1 million whose base-10
      logarithm is an integer.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The “log” button on your calculator actually stands for
      “${\log _{10}}$”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Before trying it out, can you
      estimate roughly what ${\log _{10}}\left( {4000} \right)$ will be? Check it on the calculator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">What are ${\log _{10}}\left( {40}
      \right)$, ${\log _{10}}\left( {40,000} \right)$, and ${\log
      _{10}}\left( 4 \right)$? What’s the pattern?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Pick several three-digit numbers, and use your calculator
      to find the base-10 log of each one. Now do the same with
      several four-, five-, and six-digit numbers. What do you
      notice?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _{10}}\left( 2 \right) = 0.301$, then what is
      the value of ${\log _{10}}\left( {2 \cdot {{10}^a}} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you want to see why your answer to the previous problem
    is true, try using
    the definition of log and your exponent rules to tinker with
    different ways of rewriting things, like you did earlier in
    problems 20-22. This will also help with the next two
    problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _2}\left( x \right) = 1.125$ and ${\log
      _2}\left( y \right) = 2.875$, then what is the value of
      ${\log _2}\left( {x \cdot y} \right)$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If ${\log _4}\left( x \right) = 1.20$ and ${\log _4}\left(
      y \right) = 2.009$, then what is the value of ${\log

    <h2>Introduction: Hey batta! Hey batta!</h2>

    <p>Jan bats .500 in softball — i.e., on average, for each 10
    at-bats she gets five hits. We wish to determine the
    probability that she will get no hits if she comes to bat 5
    times during a game. In order to calculate this probability we
    must assume that she stays a “.500 hitter” from one at-bat to
    the next, which is to say that success or failure at each
    at-bat is not affected by the previous at-bats. Given this
      assumption we can perform the following calculation: </p>

      <p>Probability of no hits in 5 at-bats = $ \frac{\text {number of ways of getting no hits in 5 at-bats}}{\text {number of possible outcomes in 5 at-bats}}$<br>
      = $\frac{1}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2}$<br>
      = $0.03125$  
    </p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What is the probability that Jan will get exactly one hit
      in 5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 4 hits in
      5 at-bats?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>What’s the probability that Jan will get exactly 2
      hits?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last question probably took some time to calculate since
    there are 10 different ways for Jan to get exactly 2 hits. For
    example, one string of at-bats might look like HNHNN, where H =
    “hit” and N = “no hit”. Imagine trying to calculate the
    probability that Jan would get exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats.
    Don’t do this by listing all the strings of 10 at-bats with 3
    hits. You will be cursing by the end of this process, if not
    earlier. Fortunately, there is a more elegant way of counting
    how many strings have exactly 3 hits in 10 at-bats. Let’s look
    at one approach.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>This approach will require us, first, to review two basic
    counting principles that you learned last year. Suppose you’re
    setting up a password for a new account.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      then how many possible passwords are there? The password is
      not case-sensitive so there’s no distinction between “a” and
      “A”.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 3 letters followed by 3 digits,
      but no letter or digit can be repeated, then how many
      passwords are there? Again, the passwords are not
      case-sensitive.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>If the password must be 10 digits, no letters, with no
      repetition, then how many passwords are there? There’s a nice
      shorthand way of writing this answer. Do you remember it?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The problems above involve a basic principle of counting
      called the <em class="vocab">Multiplication Principle of Counting</em>. You also
    needed to pay attention to whether repetition mattered. Lastly,
    Problem 6 alludes to some shorthand notation that comes in
    handy when the final count gets very large. Keep in mind that
    this is only notation and doesn’t solve problems for you. As
    you progress through this lesson, you’ll need to remember that
    the formulas you might derive are not all-purpose ones that
    solve counting problems. They tend to work in highly
    specialized situations. You will find more success if you read
    each problem carefully, think about what is being counted
    (visualize, even), and then apply basic principles like the
    Multiplication Principle of Counting. Now, let’s see how to
    tackle the batting problem by looking at a similar problem.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The word <em>error</em> has 5 letters in it, two letters that
      appear once and one that appears three times. We’re going to
      look at different 5-letter “words” that can be formed by
      rearranging these 5 letters. These words need not make any
      sense, so “rroer” is a word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">How many 5-letter words can be
      formed, assuming that you can tell the difference between the
      $r$’s? In other words, think of the $r$’s as being a red $r$, a
      blue $r$, and a green $r$ (or as ${r_1}$, ${r_2}$, and ${r_3}$). By the way, each of the letters can only be used once per
      word.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write down two 5-letter words that
      differ from each other only if the $r$’s are different colors.
      How many other 5-letter words differ from these two only if
      the $r$’s are different colors?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Think of another 5-letter word that
      is different from the ones in Part b. How many versions are
      there of this
      5-letter word that are distinguishable from each other
      only
      if the $r$’s are different colors? Would all of these 5-letter
      words be part of the count you made in Part a?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">So, how many 5-letter words can be
        formed by rearranging the letters in <em>error</em>, if each letter
      can only be used once per word (and the $r$’s are
      indistinguishable from each other)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Lastly, you should be able to write
      your answer to Part d in the form $\frac{5!}{n!}$. What is $n$?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
        the letters in <em>freestone</em>, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
        the letters in <em>freewheel</em>, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>How many distinguishable 9-letter words can be formed from
        the letters in <em>appraisal</em>, where each letter can only be used
      once per word?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using the letters H, H, H, H, H, N, N, N, N, N, N, N only,
      how many 12-letter words can be formed? (Note: though the
      word “distinguishable” is not appearing you should
      assume you are just counting words that are different from
      each other.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the previous problems you were always counting letters.
    If you think about what you were doing, however, you should
    realize that the method of counting wasn’t dependent on
    letters. Problem 11, for example, could have initially been a
    problem about how many ways can you step right five times and
    left seven times in a sequence of twelve steps.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Bill is flipping a coin 8 times, keeping track of the
      sequence of heads and tails. What is the probability that
      he’ll get
      exactly 5 heads in total? Exactly 4 heads? 3 heads?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Alix’s mathematics class wants to form a committee of 4
      students to investigate whether AP classes should be taught
      in the school. If there are 16 students in the class then how
      many different committees can be formed?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last problem may have seemed quite different from the
    previous ones, but there is a way of seeing it as no different.
    Imagine that you’re working with all 16 students and that you
    have 16 Velcro labels. Twelve of these labels are a large N and
    four of them are a large Y. You line the 16 students up and
    then try to count how many different ways you can assign the
    labels to the students. In this sense, you are trying to
    determine how many different ways you can arrange 12 N’s and 4
    Y’s in a sequence.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The answer to the last sentence (and to Problem 13) can be
      written in the form $\frac{{a!}}{{b!{\kern 1pt} {\kern 1pt}
      {\kern 1pt} c!}}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ have specific meanings
      in the context of the problem. What are $a$, $b$, and $c$ and what
      are their meanings?</p>

      <p>The fraction in Problem 14 can be simplified so that there
      is only one factorial expression in the denominator. Do
      this.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Look back at your answer to Problem 15 and remember that
    this fraction is an answer to Problem 13. Now, use your
    understanding of the relationship between this fraction and
    Alix’s committee problem to answer the following question.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>You’re going to order a triple-scoop bowl of ice
      cream.
      If you plan on choosing three different types of ice cream
      from 8 possible choices, then how many different triple-scoop
      combinations are there?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In this lesson you have seen some problems where two
    different orderings of the same things are to be thought of as
    being different — e.g., the passwords 3857210964 and
    6710892534. In other problems, you’ve had to discount these
    differences — e.g., the triple-scoop combination of
    chocolate-vanilla-pistachio does not differ from the
    combination pistachio-chocolate-vanilla. As you work through
    the remaining problems in these lessons, bear in mind these
    distinctions. Some problems will fall into one category and not
    the other, while some will fall into both. And, of course, some
    will fall into neither.</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>An ecologist is studying moose herds, to see if hunting
      practices are depleting the herds. In each herd, every year,
      $\frac{1}{3}$ of the population reproduces (1 baby moose
      each). Every fall, though, after the moose reproduce, hunters
      are allowed to hunt down 100 moose. In one herd, at the
      beginning of the study there are 270 moose. What would be the
      size of the herd population after 5 years? (Each year, round
      to the nearest moose.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>The situation above is an example of <em class="vocab">recursion</em> — a process
    in which the input at any particular stage depends on the
    output of a previous stage (or previous stages). In this
    particular case the size of the herd in any given year is
    dependent on its size the year before.</p>

    <p>If you understand exactly how the stages are related you can
    then express that relationship with an equation, called a
      <em class="vocab">recursive equation</em>. These equations
    will allow you to model and track changes in all sorts of
    populations — people, wildlife, bacteria, viruses, radioactive
    material and a host of others. People who use these powerful
    tools are interested in essentially three important questions:
    Will the population continue to increase without bound, will it
    level off at a
    certain number, or will it disappear after a certain
    period?</p>

    <p>Here is another example of a recursive process.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Enter any number greater than 1 in your calculator and
      find its square root. Then find the square root of your
      answer. Continue finding square roots of previous answers
      until something interesting develops. Do you think the same
      thing would happen with any number greater than 1 that you
      choose? How about any positive number less than 1?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A bacteria colony is placed into a Petri dish along with a
      bacteria-eating fungus. Every day, the bacteria population
      increases by 50%, but during the night at midnight, the
      fungus devours 50 bacteria.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Draw a chart and track the bacteria
      population over the next week, if the initial population is

    <p>The equation you wrote in problem 3e is a recursive
    equation. To fully describe a recursion process one would write
    the recursion equation together with the initial condition. In
    the case of problem 3e, for example, we would write ${B_n} =
    \frac{3}{2}{B_{n - 1}} - 50$ as well as ${B_0} = 120$. In
    mathematics, the subscript zero is sometimes used to represent
    the amount or number you started with.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>A buyer and seller are bargaining over the price of an
      antique lamp. First, the buyer offers to pay $\$400$. Next, the

      Trying to be fair, the buyer decides to average those two
      prices for his next offer of $\$600$. Also trying to be fair,
      the seller then averages the two most recent prices, to make
      her next offer. They continue bargaining, each using the
      averaging method to come up with their next offer.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>One of the simplest models for population growth is based
        on the idea that the <em>growth rate</em> of the population is
      proportional to the current size of the population. So, for
      example, we might expect that, each year, the number of frogs
      in a pond will increase by 6% every year.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Write a recursive equation for this
      model of growth.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does this equation have any
      equilibria?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>The population model you looked at in the previous problem
      has a major limitation: it doesn’t take into account the fact
      that the frogs in the pond have a limited number of resources
      (food, lily pad real estate, etc.). The following equation,
      called
      the logistic model of population growth,
      attempts to take this into account:</p>

      <p>${F_{n + 1}} = {F_n} + 1.1{F_n} \cdot \left( {\frac{{40 -
      {F_n}}}{{40}}} \right)$</p>

<p>      The idea here is that, the pond has a “carrying capacity” of
      40 frogs — i.e., it has enough resources for 40 frogs to live
      healthily. So, while the population’s growth rate is
      proportional to the current population size, it is also
      proportional to how close the population is to the carrying
      capacity.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Suppose that there were 15 frogs in
      the pond. According to the equation, how much would the
      population change the next year? How about if there were 35
      frogs in the pond?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Does it seem plausible that this
      system (unlike the one in the previous problem) would have an
      equilibrium solution other than 0?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">Starting with an initial population
      of 2 frogs, use the equation above to track the frog
      population over several years. What happens in the long
      run?</p>

    <p>Use your calculator to plot these data, with the Facebook
    population on the $y$-axis, and time in months on the $x$-axis.
    Then, try to predict how many people were on Facebook at the
    beginning of 2010.</p>
      
</div>
    
    <p>Looking at the data, it’s quite clear that the Facebook
    population has been growing over time, and it’s also pretty
    easy to see that the $rate$ at which it’s growing is
    increasing, too. Even if we take those two observations into
    account, though, there seems to be quite a wide range of
    plausible predictions in problem 1. It’s hard to know how to
    decide whether, say, 375 million users or 500 million users is
    the better prediction.</p>

    <p>What if we could find an equation that appeared to fit the
    existing data very well? In that case, we would have reason to
    believe that the equation was a good mathematical model for
    Facebook population growth, and we could therefore make more
    specific, confident predictions.</p>

    <p>If you’ve studied biology, you might have seen that
    exponential models are one of the simplest and most common
    types of models used for population growth. Even though
    Facebook isn’t quite same as, say, bacteria in a Petri dish, it
    turns out that these data indeed appear to exhibit exponential
    growth. Let’s find an exponential function that fits the data.
    Recall that, by definition, an exponential function has an
    equation in the form $y = a \cdot {b^x}$, where $a$ and $b$ are
    constants.</p>
      
    

    <div class="problem">
      <p>To find constants for our data, we’ll need to substitute
      two points into the general exponential equation, and then
      solve the resulting pair of equations for $a$ and $b$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">We have more points than we need:
      since there are only two constants to solve for, we actually
      only need two points. Which of the following pairs of points
      do you think we should use to get the best fit for the whole
      data set? Why?
      <br>
        $\left( {12,1} \right)$ and $\left( {24,5.5} \right)$
      <br>
      $\left( {24,5.5} \right)$ and $\left( {64,200}
      \right)$
      <br>
      $\left( {36,12} \right)$ and $\left( {62,175}
      \right)$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">For each of the pairs of points in
      part a, find the equation of an exponential function that
      goes through the two points. Then, use your calculator to
      graph each of these three equations together with the actual
      data. Which one was the best fit? Which was worst? Why?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Using whichever equation from problem 2 fit the data best,
      predict the Facebook population at the beginning of 2010.
      Compare your predictions to the actual data, available at:

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Jenn Jeffings, ecologist extraordinaire, has taken some
    data, shown below, on chestnut oak trees in the woods around
    her house. She used the house as home base, and counted the
    number of chestnut oaks within certain distances. So, for
    example, the second row in the table indicates that Jenn
    counted 63 chestnut oaks that were each no more than 10 meters
    away from the house. Plot these data using your calculator.</p>

    <p>You can see clearly that, just as with the Facebook data,
    the $y$ values are increasing<br>
    at a faster and faster rate.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Are the data exponential? Either use an equation and some
      algebra, or else work directly with the numbers to answer
      this question.</p>
    </div>

    <p>It turns out that Jenn’s tree data can be modeled accurately
      using a <em class="vocab">power function</em>, which is any function that can be described with an equation of the form $y = a \cdot {x^n}$, where $a$ and $n$
    are constants.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Strategically pick two points and use them to solve for
      the constants $a$ and $n$. Check out the particular equation
      that results by graphing it on your calculator together with
      the data.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>According to the model you made in problem 5, how many
      chestnut oaks are within 100 meters of Jenn’s house?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The equation you came up with in problem 5 is just one
    example of a power function. Let’s take a brief look at these
    functions in general.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Is the graph of $y = 5{x^2}$ exactly five times steeper
      than the graph of $y = {x^2}$ ? Is it exactly five times
      higher? Experiment with some values of $a$ other than 5, and
      see if you can get any different effects. In each case, it
      will be helpful to compare your graph to the more basic $y =
      {x^2}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Graph $y = {x^4}$ and $y = {x^5}$ on your calculator.
      Compare them to $y = {x^2}$ and $y = {x^3}$. Now predict
      what $y = {x^{94}}$ and $y = {x^{95}}$ will look like.
      Check your prediction. What can you say in general about
      power functions where $n$ is a positive integer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Find the coordinates of a specific point that <em>must</em> be on
      the graph of $y = 3{x^n}$, regardless of the value of $n$.
      Then find one more.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Let’s go back to the Facebook data we looked at in the
    introduction. In problem 2, you should have seen that the
    equation $P = 0.637 \cdot {1.094^t}$ fit the data best. For
    consistency, let’s use that equation for the following
    problems.</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Suppose you were writing a <em>Postscript</em> article about
      Facebook’s incredible exponential growth, and you wanted to
      include a prediction about when we would expect the Facebook
      population to reach 1 billion users. According to the
      equation, when will this happen?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>According to the equation, how long will it be after your
      answer to the previous problem until the population reaches 2
        billion users? And how long after <em>that</em> until it hits 4
      billion users?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Write an equation that expresses the time $t$, as a
      function of the population $P$. In other words, rewrite the
      equation $P = 0.637 \cdot {1.094^t}$ in “$t = $ ” form.</p>
    </div>

    <p>On the one hand, you could think of this equation as being
    the same as, or equivalent to, the original “$P = $ ”
    equation. On the other hand, though, it’s quite clear that in
    this equation, the “input” and “output” variables have been
    reversed. As you might recall from the lesson on algorithms,
    this means that the equation you wrote in problem 12 represents
      the <em class="vocab">inverse</em> of the original function. (Actually, they are inverses of each other.)</p>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Equations of the form $y = a{\log _b}\left( x \right) + c$ are called <em class="vocab">logarithmic functions</em>. If you haven’t already, use a bit of algebra to show that the equation you wrote in problem 12 is, indeed, a logarithmic function. Why does it make sense that the inverse of an exponential function would be a
      logarithmic function?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem">
      <p>Below is a graph of the equation $P = 0.637 \cdot
      {1.094^t}$ .</p>

      using your calculator, make a large (at least half-page) and
      accurate graph of your equation from problem 12. (Remember
      that, typically, we put the output on the vertical axis and the
      input on the horizontal axis.) What do you notice about the graph?</p>

      <p>One night, at their vacation home in Maine, Brad Pitt and
      Angelina Jolie had a fight. Brad couldn’t sleep that night,
      and so he was up when the sun rose at 7:04am. By the time it
      set at 4:22pm, they still hadn’t made up. Using the data in
      the table, is it possible to say which day of the year
      Brangelina had their fight?</p>

      <p>Often, when we are trying to model a phenomenon using mathematics, we’re interested in using one variable, called the <em>input</em>, to predict the value of another
        variable, the <em>output</em>. This is generally only possible, however, if the input uniquely determines the output — or, in other words, when there is at
      most one output for any given input. When this is the case,
        we say that the relationship is a <em class="vocab">function</em>. This was true,
      for example, in the Facebook population example at the
      beginning of the lesson, but it was $not$ the case in problem

      <p>The data you’ve seen in the previous problem, as well as
      in problem 29, are examples of what’s called the “80-20
      rule,” or the “Pareto principle.” Vilfredo Pareto, an economist in the late
      1800’s, made two oddly related observations: 80 percent of
      Italy’s wealth was owned by roughly 20 percent of the
      population, and 80 percent of the peas he harvested in his
      garden came from roughly 20 percent of the pea plants.
      (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle.)
      </p>
      <p>Since then, a surprising number of phenomena
      have been discovered to follow this general rule. Here’s
        another example.</p>
      
      <div class="problem"><p>The data set below comes from a study of how
      often different words appear in a large sample of English
      text. The first column represents a certain level of rarity
      or commonness for a word, and the second column shows how
      many words had appeared with that frequency.
      So, for example, there were 586 words that appeared around
      200 times, whereas there were only 73 words that appeared 600
      times.</p>
